It's not an easy task.  You've got six misses in which to match wits with the computer for a higher score.  Each time the bricks in the canyon are hit, the remaining bricks \"fall\" to a lower level (rather than remaining stationary in their original position).  Bricks that fall to a lower level are worth the points designated for that level.\r\n\r\nKeep an eye on the solid bar beneath your score on the upper right side of the screen.  It is a \"miss indicator\" and gradually decreases in length each time you miss until six misses are recorded and the game ends.  The bar is also color-coordinated with your planes and your score.\r\n\r\nSet your sights for 1000 points.  Although the game will not end if you reach the 1000 point mark, it's an excellent goal to set for yourself since it will be very difficult to obtain.\r\n\r\nGAME 2: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)\r\nThis game differs from Game 1 only in that you are competing against another player rather than the computer.  Play ends when six misses are recorded against both players.  the player with the highest score wins. \r\n\r\nDon't forget to keep an eye on your opponent's \"miss indicator\" as well as your own.  Bombs away!\r\n\r\nGAME 3: Canyon Bomber (One-Player)\r\nThis one's the same as Game 1 with one exception.  Rather than falling to a lower level, the bricks in the canyon stay \"suspended\" in their original position when the surrounding bricks are hit.\r\n\r\nGAME 4: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)\r\nYou compete with another player the same as in Game 2.  This time however, the brick remain suspended instead of falling to a lower level.\r\n\r\nGAME 5: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)\r\nGet set for a test of your endurance and concentration.  The first player to score 1000 points wins.  No time limit and no limit to the number of bombs or misses.  Falling, rather than suspended bricks are programed into this game.\r\n\r\nNo \"miss indicator\" will appear on the screen in games with unlimited bombs.\r\n\r\nGAME 6: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)\r\nThis game program is identical to Game 5, except that the bricks stay suspended.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA BOMBER GAMES\r\n\r\nGAME 7: Sea Bomber (One-Player)\r\nYou're playing against the computer.  Set the level, release the bomb, and boom, you're ready for action.  Sounds easy, but the computer's a real steady competitor.  If you score 1000 points before the computer does, you're a winner!\r\n\r\nGAME 8: Sea Bomber (Two-Player)\r\nThis time you're competing against another player in a race to the 1000 point mark.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcgjkcCbZzc","Publisher":"Atari","Developer":"Atari","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"12131","PlatformId":"23"}},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/22147-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"584","height":"782","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/22147-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22147-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1440","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22147-1.jpg"}}},"Carnival":{},"Carnival Shooter (PD)":{},"Casino":{"id":"1345","GameTitle":"Casino","PlatformId":"22","Platform":"Atari 2600","Overview":"There are 3 card games available: Black Jack, Stud Poker and Poker Solitaire","Genres":{"genre":"Strategy"},"Players":"4+","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sears","Developer":"Atari","Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1345-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1345-1.jpg"},"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/1345-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"800","height":"1080","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1345-1.jpg"}}}},"Cat Trax":{"id":"38191","GameTitle":"Cat Trax","PlatformId":"22","Platform":"Atari 2600","Overview":"It's an age-old battle of cats versus dogs.

Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Atari","Developer":"Atari","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"4897","PlatformId":"27"},{"id":"5731","PlatformId":"30"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1368-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1538","height":"2099","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1368-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1368-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1525","height":"2099","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1368-1.jpg"}}]}},"Diagnostic Cartridge":{},"Dice Puzzle":{"id":"31859","GameTitle":"Dice Puzzle","PlatformId":"22","Platform":"Atari 2600","ReleaseDate":"10/01/1983","Overview":"If you enjoy games like Rubik's Cube, then you'll like this one.

Players begin with five lives and receive an extra life at 10,000 points.\r\n\r\nCaptain Link's level is a Space Invaders clone that finds Captain Link battling egg-dropping chickens. Bonus points can be scored by shooting Gonzo's spinning head as it crosses the top of the screen. Unlike Space Invaders, the alien chickens do not advance to the bottom of the screen, and the game ends either when Captain Link destroys all the chickens, or all of your lives have depleted.\r\n\r\nFirst Officer Piggy's level closely resembles Frogger, in that you must maneuver her up the screen to the Swinetrek before it crosses the screen. Hindering your progress is space spaghetti and meatballs, which fly quickly from the left and right. The meatballs can be eaten if timed right, but if the cosmic pasta hits First Officer Piggy, she tumbles back down the screen. One life will be lost if the Swinetrek is not reached in time. \r\n\r\nThe final level is Dr. Strangepork's, who pilots the Swinetrek through a treacherous canyon lined with laser-firing Gonzoids. Destroy the Gonzoids by using the Swinetrek's boomer-ray, a cannon that fires boomerang-like missiles.","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Atari","Developer":"Atari","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/17528-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"600","height":"813","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/17528-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/17528-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"498","height":"680","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/17528-1.jpg"}}]}},"Pink Floyd (Kyle Pittman) (PD)":{},"Pins Revenge (Atari Freak 1)":{},"Pitfall II - Lost Caverns":{"id":"17529","GameTitle":"Pitfall II: Lost Caverns","AlternateTitles":{"title":["Pitfall II","Pitfall II - Lost Caverns"]},"PlatformId":"22","Platform":"Atari 2600","ReleaseDate":"09/16/1983","Overview":"Here I am, Pitfall Harry, plummeting toward the dark thunder of rushing water below... and thinking of the night David Crane called. \"I hope you're well rested,\" he had said.

You are a kangaroo who loves to paint trampolines green. However, a squirrel likes to paint them blue. Naturally, this can result in some hectic competition between the two. Jumping on one of the trampolines will turn it the color of your character and earn you points. During the game the trampolines scroll down to the bottom of the screen before they disappear. Naturally, you must avoid being on a trampoline when it disappears, otherwise you will lose a life.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, you may find a special square that will cause your character to flash. If you jump onto a trampoline where the other character is, they will be stunned briefly, giving you an opportunity to make them lose a life. What is truly unique is how the computer player also has a limited number of lives just like the human player does. After one player loses all of their lives, the other player is awarded extra points for his or her remaining lives. If you want to get big points, you have to adopt a different strategy to avoid having your opponent lose all their lives. Truly a unique and fun experience, although the game can be frustrating to play against the computer as you'll find it easy to stay alive longer than the computer.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Imagic","Developer":"Imagic","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/38222-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"600","height":"804","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/38222-1.jpg"}}}},"RPG Kernal (18-04-2003) (Paul Slocum) (PD)":{},"RUN Platform Demo (PD)":{},"Rabbit Transit":{"id":"34336","GameTitle":"Rabbit Transit","PlatformId":"22","Platform":"Atari 2600","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1983","Overview":"You are a rabbit who is just trying to get to where you can get a mate and make like a mathematician by multiplying.

Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Activision","Developer":"Activision","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/5323-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1527","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/5323-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/5323-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1530","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/5323-1.jpg"}}]}},"Robotfindskitten2600":{},"Roc n' Rope":{"id":"5324","GameTitle":"Roc 'N Rope","PlatformId":"22","Platform":"Atari 2600","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1984","Overview":"Your player is a mountain climber who must avoid cavemen, dinosaurs and pterodactyls as he climbs up the cliff-sides.

When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly.

A mystical dragon sets out to find crystals of fire, air, and water, in order to gain special powers, and eggs which will hatch into new dragons. The dragon must defeat enemies by shooting fireballs, which is accomplished by pushing the joystick upwards and in the direction the player wishes to shoot in. Some enemies can be killed with one shot, others with two, and some take more and more fireballs to be killed as the game progresses. What is truly unique about this game is that the fire and water crystals must never be dropped off consecutively, or else they will destroy one another. An air crystal must separate the two. Also, players must learn to conserve fireballs, otherwise they will find they have no way of defending themselves against their enemies.

Greg Troutman managed to squeeze a text adventure into an 8K Atari 2600 cart, and although it's much simpler in execution than Infocom's offerings, it's an enjoyable game nonetheless.\r\n\r\nIn Dark Mage, you play the role of a jester banished from your kingdom and your goal is to find and return the king's black rose. As in most text adventures you explore the game world by moving through the four compass directions, find and use items and talk with characters you encounter along the way. This is all accomplished with relative ease through the use of the joystick controller, there's no typing here!","Genres":{"genre":"Adventure"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Hozer","Developer":"Troutman","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/38195-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"400","height":"480","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/38195-1.jpg"}}}},"Death Derby (19-01-2003) (TJ) ":{},"Death Derby (v0001) (Glenn Saunders) (PD)":{},"Death Derby (v0002) (Glenn Saunders) (PD)":{},"Death Derby (v0003) (Glenn Saunders) (PD)":{},"Death Derby (v0004) (Glenn Saunders) (PD)":{},"Death Derby (v0005 New Build) (Glenn Saunders) (PD)":{},"Death Derby (v0005) (Glenn Saunders) (PD)":{},"Death Derby (v0006) (Glenn Saunders) (PD)":{},"Death Derby (v0007) (Glenn Saunders) (PD)":{},"Death Derby (v0008) (Glenn Saunders) (PD)":{},"Death Derby (v0010) (Glenn Saunders) (PD)":{},"Death Derby (v0011) (Glenn Saunders) (PD)":{},"Dizzy Wiz (B.
