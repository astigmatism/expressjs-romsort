Castle Blast is Ronen Habot's first foray into programming the Atari 5200. Ronen used this experience as a means to write a tutorial on Atari 5200 programming to assist others who might want to write games for the system.\r\n\r\nCastle Blast made its debut at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo, where it was sold with a box, manual and cart. AtariAge held a Castle Blast Label Contest in April, 2002. Castle Blast may be ordered directly from the author, Ronen Habot, by visiting the Castle Blast Development Page.\r\n\r\nThe object of this game is to destroy the Castle on the Mothership. You fire Vertical Trajectory Missiles, or VTMs, at the shield on the bottom of the Mothership. When you penetrate the shield, then blast the Castle. To score extra points, you can also shoot the enemy spaceships flying overhead.\r\n\r\nIf you destroy the Castle, you advance to the next level, where you will need to contend with Focused Energy Beams, or FEBs, fired from the Mothership. There will also be stars appearing in the sky, making it harder to target the spaceships.\r\n\r\nIf you manage to obliterate the Castle again, you will proceed to the next level, which adds ground-based tanks assaulting you. You have Horizontal Trajectory Missiles, or HTMs, to deal with this new enemy but do not lose sight of your primary goal.\r\n\r\nYour joystick moves you left or right. The lower button fires VTMs, the upper button fires HTMs.","ESRB":"EC - Early Childhood","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Flight Simulator"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Self-Published","Developer":"Ronen Habot","Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/22376-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/22376-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/22376-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1532","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/22376-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/22376-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1534","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/22376-1.jpg"}}],"banner":{"_":"graphical/22376-g.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22376-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"400"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22376-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22376-2.jpg","$":{"width":"336","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22376-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22376-3.jpg","$":{"width":"336","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22376-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22376-4.jpg","$":{"width":"336","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22376-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22376-5.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"400"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22376-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22376-6.jpg","$":{"width":"336","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22376-6.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22376-7.jpg","$":{"width":"336","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22376-7.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22376-8.jpg","$":{"width":"336","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22376-8.jpg"}]}},"Centipede ":{"id":"5141","GameTitle":"Centipede","PlatformId":"26","Platform":"Atari 5200","Overview":"The player moves the character about the bottom area of the screen and fires laser shots at a centipede advancing from the top of the screen down through a field of mushrooms.

There are two kinds of enemies in the game:\r\nPookas - A race of round red monsters (said to be modeled after tomatoes) who wear yellow goggles.\r\nFygars - A race of green dragons who can breathe fire.\r\nThe player's character is Dig Dug, dressed in white and blue, and able to dig tunnels through destructible environments. Dig Dug is killed if he is caught by either Pooka or Fygar, burned by a Fygar's fire, or crushed by a rock.\r\nA partially inflated monster will gradually deflate and recover after a few seconds, during which time the player can pass safely through it. The monsters normally crawl through the tunnels in the dirt but can turn into ghostly eyes and travel slowly through the dirt. The last enemy on a level will try to escape off the top left of the screen.\r\nMore points are awarded for popping an enemy further down in the dirt (the levels are color-coded). In addition, Fygars are worth double points if exploded horizontally, since they can only breathe fire horizontally in the direction they are facing. Extra points are also awarded for dropping rocks on enemies in order to eliminate them rather than inflating them. If one enemy is killed by the rock, it is worth 1000 points. The next two add 1500 points each, and any after that add 2000. The act of digging is itself worth points, giving 10 points for each block dug, so some players do as much of it as possible in situations where the threat from the remaining monsters is minimal.\r\nAfter the player drops two rocks, fruits and vegetables and other edible bonus items, such as Galaxian flagships appear in the center of the play field, and can be collected for points if the player is able to reach them before they disappear. These edible bonus items will appear even if the rocks fail to hit any enemies. In some versions of the game, the most points attainable from a single bonus fruit is 8,000 from the pineapple.","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd6TTrVdm7s","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"10","Game":[{"id":"36444","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"36806","PlatformId":"22"},{"id":"38189","PlatformId":"27"},{"id":"10123","PlatformId":"31"},{"id":"32546","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"10509","PlatformId":"32"},{"id":"16994","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"18619","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"25283","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"37801","PlatformId":"4953"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/5153-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/5153-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/5153-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1532","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/5153-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/5153-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1534","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/5153-1.jpg"}}],"banner":{"_":"graphical/5153-g.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/5153-1.jpg","$":{"width":"480","height":"360"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/5153-1.jpg"},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/5153.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"118"}}}},"Dreadnaught Factor, The ":{},"Final Legacy ":{"id":"34471","GameTitle":"Final Legacy","PlatformId":"26","Platform":"Atari 5200","Overview":"This is a battle on three fronts. You are the captain of the ship Legacy. Your ultimate goal is to destroy the Warmongers' missile bases but you must also protect your cities.\r\n\r\nYou begin the game in command mode. You select your other modes with the joystick. Up for navigation, down for torpedo, left for sea-to-air and right for sea-to-land.\r\n\r\nNavigation\r\nIn navigation mode, you will see an overhead map of the world. You will note that there is a black dot in a black circle. This is you and the circle represents your effective range. You move the circle about the screen to target ships or known missile bases or to refuel at a city. You use fuel only when you are in navigation mode. When you are within range, or if an enemy ships comes within your range, press the space bar to return to the command mode then change to the desired mode.\r\n\r\nTorpedo\r\nIf you are within range of an enemy ship, switch to torpedo mode. In this mode, you will use the scanner at the bottom to line up your target. Move out of line to avoid a direct hit. Beware of war ship as they will chase you and have the most firepower. Hunter ships will also chase you. While their firepower is not as high as war ships, it is still fairly good. Intelligence ships have the weakest firepower and will not chase you. They can be found on the right side of the screen. If one is destroyed and there are any hidden missile bases, there is a eighty percent chance a hidden base will be revealed.\r\n\r\nSea-to-land\r\nIf you want to destroy a missile base or refuel, enter sea-to-land mode. To refuel, get near a city then enter this mode. When you are in sea-to-land mode, you will know you are within range if you see \"Dock for refueling\" on the screen. You then place the cross hairs on the base of the city and wait for refueling to complete, unless you or a city are under attack. Do not use the fire button to exit or you will fire on your city. To destroy a missile base, position your cross hairs using the scanner on the screen until you are on a missile launcher then fire. Be advised that when you fire on a missile base, they will shoot missiles at a city.\r\n\r\nSea-to-air\r\nIf a city is under attach, switch to this mode. You will control a weapons satellite.

Unfortunately this house is infested with mice which roam the screen, gnawing through pipes and generally causing problems for our man Tom.\r\n\r\nOnce a mouse gnaws through a pipe, you'll see the flow of water stop and a pipe piece will fall to the ground.  To repair the pipe Tom must pick up the fallen piece (you can hold two pieces a time), and put it back into the hole.  To get to where the holes are, Tom must carefully climb up and navigate the maze of pipes.  Although Tom can cross short gaps in the pipes, he'll need to go around the larger ones.  While climbing around on the pipes, Tom will run across several different kinds of mice. Each mouse has its own color and purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen the flow of water is interrupted, the timer in the reservoir will begin to count downward from 5000 at the rate of 100 points per second.  The only way to stop this countdown is to restore the water flow by fixing the pipes.  If the timer reaches zero, Tom will lose a life and play the current level over again.  If Tom is able to get enough water into the reservoir (keeping the timer above 1500), he'll be rewarded with a bonus intermission showing a woman taking a shower.\r\n\r\n- Excerpt from www.atariprotos.com","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wswlpoL6wRc","Publisher":"Atari","Developer":"Atari","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"38904","PlatformId":"23"}},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/34472-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"177","height":"233","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/34472-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/34472-1.jpg","$":{"width":"336","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/34472-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/34472-2.jpg","$":{"width":"336","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/34472-2.jpg"}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/34472.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"150"}}}},"Frogger ":{"id":"5156","GameTitle":"Frogger","PlatformId":"26","Platform":"Atari 5200","Overview":"Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen.

To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Adventure","Platform"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Activision","Developer":"Activision","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"10339","PlatformId":"31"},{"id":"33529","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"36685","PlatformId":"4929"},{"id":"33244","PlatformId":"4949"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/5164-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1532","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/5164-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/5164-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1534","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/5164-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/5164.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"225"}}}},"Hello There James (1999) (PD)":{},"Hello World by Dan Boris (1998) (PD)":{},"Irata's Quest by John Swiderski (Dec 12) (2002) (PD)":{},"Irata's Quest by John Swiderski (Dec 16) (2002) (PD)":{},"Irata's Quest by John Swiderski (Dec 23) (2002) (PD)":{},"James Bond 007 ":{"id":"5165","GameTitle":"James Bond 007","PlatformId":"26","Platform":"Atari 5200","ReleaseDate":"11/02/1984","Overview":"When it comes to fast-paced action and intrigue, nobody does it better than Bond.

Pressing the button while pushing the joystick will cause Pengo to push forward the ice block he is facing, which will slide until it hits a wall or another ice block, crushing any intervening Sno-Bees. Crushing more than one Sno-Bee at once will increase the number of points awarded. There are a total of sixteen levels, which repeat in order starting on the seventeenth round.\r\nAs the player crushes those on patrol, new Sno-Bees hatch from eggs located within ice blocks. At the start of each level, blocks that contain these eggs are briefly identified by flashing the color of that level's Sno-Bees. Eggs can be eliminated by crushing the ice blocks that contain them. If Pengo pushes a side wall the water \"vibrates\", any adjacent Sno-Bees will be briefly stunned, and are eliminated (for 100 points) if Pengo walks over them in this state. Eliminating all Sno-Bees in a round will progress the player to the next.\r\nDiamond blocks are unbreakable; when connected in a horizontal or vertical line the player earns bonus points: 10,000 points if aligned without being against a wall or if only one diamond block is touching a wall, 5,000 points if all three are against the wall. Alignment will also temporarily stun all Sno-Bees.\r\nAfter 60 seconds elapse in a round without a death, the game enters into sudden death mode; the music tempo and movement of the Sno-Bees accelerates. If a single Sno-Bee remains in the round, a jingle plays and the Sno-Bee accelerates in an attempt to reach a corner where it safely fades away.\r\nThe game will always start with the same maze on power up.

Part Zaxxon and part Star Raiders, Spitfire appears to have been Atari's first attempt into the realm of 3D shooters.  While the current known prototype may not be very complete (approx. 50%), it shows that the 5200 was indeed capable of 3D graphics.\r\n\r\nAccording to the dictionary, a Spitfire is a plane from World War II.

While this may look a bit overwhelming, only the first three rows of octagons are ever used.  While the units may be spaced out over the map, this doesn't make any difference since your target is selected with the * key (perhaps you may have had to fly to your target in later versions?).  After selecting a target its statistics will be displayed in the status bar at the bottom of the screen.

You take control of goofy as he competes in two events, the Marathon Dive and the Pogo Pop.\r\n\r\nThe Marathon Dive is a game in which you must guide Goofy up a series of platforms so he can reach the diving platform and jump off before the timer runs out.  As Goofy climbs up the platforms he must avoid little armored tanks, which will chase Goofy around.  Thankfully these tanks can't jump, reverse direction, or use the ladders, so they can be avoided by jumping over them or leading them into a hole (which will cause them to fall down to the next level).  Also hindering Goofy's progress are large gaps in the platforms which must be carefully jumped over.  If Goofy falls through a hole he'll fall down one level but is otherwise unharmed, however if he is hit by a tank he'll loose a life.\r\n \r\nIf Goofy makes it to the top of the platform he will run off the end, making it about halfway across the screen before realizing that he's running in mid-air.  Now Goofy will begin to fall, and you must guide him down to the little floating platform below.  However the floating platform is constantly moving in an erratic fashion, so hitting it can be tough.  If you successfully reach the platform, Goofy will smash into it and have his parachute open a second too late (in typical cartoon fashion).  If you miss the platform Goofy will fall into the water and drown (I guess he doesn't know how to swim).  As the levels progress the tanks will begin to move faster and faster, the diving platform has more holes in it, and the floating platform moves more erratically.  Eventually the difficulty will wrap around however, and the game will get very easy again.\r\n\r\nPogo Pop takes place on a series of squares where Goofy bounces up and down on a pogo stick in an effort to touch every tile.  This may sound easy but there's a catch, every time you jump one of the tiles disappears, so the tile that was below you may not be there when you land.  As the levels progress the frequency of the tiles disappearing increases, making it harder and harder not to fall through the floor.  \r\n \r\nWhile you're jumping on tiles you can attempt to pop the Mickey Mouse balloons floating above you for extra points.  The balloons come in several different colors and are worth a varying amount of points.","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Sports"]},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khYbKE34oqU","Publisher":"Atari","Developer":"Atari","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/34490-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1440","height":"1080","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/34490-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/34490-1.jpg","$":{"width":"336","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/34490-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/34490-2.jpg","$":{"width":"336","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/34490-2.jpg"}]}},"Star Raiders ":{"id":"5217","GameTitle":"Star Raiders","PlatformId":"26","Platform":"Atari 5200","Overview":"\"The code name for this operation is WIPEOUT.

Players navigate through ten levels and a base, where they must safely make it through the level and safely remove the booty. The levels are described as follows,\r\nPlayer must maneuver the chopper over mountainous terrain against fast and slow firing rockets.\r\nChopper faces Arcing missiles over a mountain terrain.\r\nSmart Bombs flying in groups of four over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.\r\nSingle Smart Bombs over mountainous terrain. Again, Rockets appear, but do not fire.\r\nChopper flies through a cavern-like terrain against falling mines.\r\nRapidly firing, roving tanks over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.\r\nManeuver through a field of meteors which explode when hit with bombs or 3 times with laser, plus a single, green, shadow meteor directly in front of chopper which explodes when hit five times with laser. Rockets appear but do not fire.\r\nChopper flies over mountainous terrain against rapidly firing UFOs. Tanks and rockets appear, but do not fire.\r\nChopper faces arcing missiles over tall buildings.\r\nFiring rockets in a building maze.\r\nBase: Player must maneuver the chopper over tall buildings against arcing missiles and rapidly firing tanks to reach the Booty and safely carry it away.\r\nThere is no intermission between each section; the game simply scrolls into the new terrain. If the player destroys the booty on the final level, they must start back at the beginning of the level.","Genres":{"genre":"Shooter"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Parker Bros","Developer":"Parker Bros","Rating":"4","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"6","Game":[{"id":"31217","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"28597","PlatformId":"22"},{"id":"32935","PlatformId":"31"},{"id":"10547","PlatformId":"32"},{"id":"22887","PlatformId":"4927"},{"id":"35632","PlatformId":"4929"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/5222-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1532","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/5222-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/5222-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1534","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/5222-1.jpg"}}],"banner":{"_":"graphical/5222-g.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/5222.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"182"}}}},"Super Pac-Man ":{"id":"5223","GameTitle":"Super Pac-Man","PlatformId":"26","Platform":"Atari 5200","Overview":"In a very good adaptation of one of the lesser-known Pac-Man sequels, Super Pac-Man for the Atari 5200 speeds up the action -- and drastically shortens the effectiveness of the power pills and super power pills gobbled up by Pac-Man.

You can use the joystick or the trackball controller.\r\n \r\nEach player resembles a hollow paddle (like a capsule), which you can move around your side of the screen.  Your paddle can catch and hold up to three fireballs (the little star looking things that the Xari's shoot), and each stored fireball allows you to destroy one Xari by running into it.  If you hit a Xari without any fireballs stored in your paddle, it is temporarily stunned and you cannot catch or deflect any shots for a few seconds.  If you already have three fireballs stored up, your paddle will start reflecting the fireballs back at the Xari's (a great tactic for those hard to reach guys that won't come near you) and at your partner (which is not so good).  You can choose to reflect shots even if you don't have three fireballs stored up by pressing the bottom controller button.\r\n \r\nIf things start to get out of control you can activate your fire extinguisher (using the top controller button) to temporarily protect your blocks.  The fire extinguisher coats your blocks with foam and will destroy any shots that touch it.  the foam moves quickly down your blocks and only lasts for a few seconds so you have to use it wisely (like when fireballs get behind your blocks).
