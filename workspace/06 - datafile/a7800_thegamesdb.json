Your goal in the arcade version of the game is to build up a castle using pieces to form a wall around your territory. After your castle is built, you then place cannons and use them to fire at enemy ships or another player's castle. After each round you then have an opportunity to rebuild your castle before the next round begins.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the 7800 port of Rampart that is currently available is in an early state and not complete in terms of gameplay or graphics, which is immediately obvious by the lack of a proper title screen. Rampart requires a two-button 7800 joystick. You can select difficulty and number of players, including one player, two players, team or competition modes. Gameplay consists of shooting the enemy targets, which appear as \"NME\" graphics. The left joystick button fires your normal weapon. The right fire button will destroy all enemies onscreen. If you choose a two player game (team or competition), both players can shoot at enemy targets. There are several different playfield backgrounds depending on the game type selected, or if you play additional games.\r\n\r\nA partially compiled version of Rampart was discovered by Curt Vendel, and thanks to the efforts 7800 enthusiasts Robert DeCrescenzo, Mitchell Orman, and Eckhard Stolberg, made playable on 7800 hardware. Internal Atari memos from 1993 mention that the game is almost finalized, so a more complete version of the game must exist somewhere.","Co-op":"No","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"12","Game":[{"id":"16298","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"16296","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"27036","PlatformId":"4924"},{"id":"16295","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"2037","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"16293","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"16294","PlatformId":"41"},{"id":"16297","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"4587","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"11522","PlatformId":"35"},{"id":"16292","PlatformId":"12"},{"id":"5804","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/22384-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"524","height":"700","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/22384-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-2.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-3.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-4.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-5.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-6.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-6.jpg"}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/22384.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"117"}}}},"Raster Music Tracker (PD)":{},"RealSports Baseball ":{"id":"21055","GameTitle":"RealSports Baseball","PlatformId":"27","Platform":"Atari 7800","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1988","Overview":"You smell the freshly cut grass as you walk out of the dark, cool tunnel into the hot afternoon sun.

Now Earth is threatened by deadly aliens and you must use your creation to save the planet. The Sentinel absorbs energy from every power pod or energy capsule you shoot with your Atari light gun.

Thanks to ResQsoft, an NTSC version is also available for gamers in the Western Hemisphere. Sentinel is a light gun game that is similar to Crossbow in the aspect that you are in charge of protecting your ally, in this case the Sentinel, from attack. The game features four stages, each which its own name and level boss. What makes the game unique is that shooting the large orange Sentinel acts as a smart bomb, destroying everything on the screen. While Sentinel is a very hard title to find in the wild in the Americas, this game is pretty common in Europe and can normally be purchased through online auctions at a reasonable price.","Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Atari","Developer":"Atari","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/22386-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"600","height":"827","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/22386-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/22386-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"524","height":"700","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/22386-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-2.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-3.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-4.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-5.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-6.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-6.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-7.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-7.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-8.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-8.jpg"}]}},"Sirius ":{},"Small Sprite Demo 2 - Animations by Heaven_TQA (V20040117) (PD)":{},"Small Sprite Demo by Heaven_TQA (V20040117) (PD)":{},"Space Duel":{},"Space Invaders 7800":{"id":"28406","GameTitle":"Space Invaders","PlatformId":"27","Platform":"Atari 7800","ReleaseDate":"01/01/2008","Overview":"Space Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens.

The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating the aliens brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue indefinitely.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Shooter"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"AtariAge","Developer":"Bob DeCrescenzo","Rating":"9","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"13","Game":[{"id":"116","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"4890","PlatformId":"22"},{"id":"5214","PlatformId":"26"},{"id":"3295","PlatformId":"3"},{"id":"27281","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"21237","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"3506","PlatformId":"5"},{"id":"8667","PlatformId":"41"},{"id":"36659","PlatformId":"4949"},{"id":"11607","PlatformId":"10"},{"id":"3263","PlatformId":"6"},{"id":"38181","PlatformId":"34"},{"id":"27667","PlatformId":"4925"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/28406-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"482","height":"577","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/28406-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/28406.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"200"}}}},"Space War by Eric Ball (V20030930) (PD)":{},"Space War by Eric Ball (V20031018) (PD)":{},"Space War by Eric Ball (V20040318) (PD)":{},"Space War by Eric Ball (V20070319) (PD)":{},"Space War by Eric Ball (V20070321) (PD)":{},"Spikes Added":{},"Summer Games ":{},"Super Circus":{},"Super Huey UH-IX ":{"id":"21059","GameTitle":"Super Huey UH-IX","PlatformId":"27","Platform":"Atari 7800","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1988","Overview":"A port of the 1985 Cosmi home computer game, Atari released this for the 7800 in 1988.

To do this, you will need to blast your way through their defenses on three levels of increasing difficulty.

Here you have a vertical scroller like Commando or Ikari Warriors minus the charm, quality level design, and reasonable difficulty. There are only three levels in the game, but just like its Froggo cousin Water Ski, the difficulty ramps so severely after the mindless first level that continuing takes strong will.

Your goal in the arcade version of the game is to build up a castle using pieces to form a wall around your territory. After your castle is built, you then place cannons and use them to fire at enemy ships or another player's castle. After each round you then have an opportunity to rebuild your castle before the next round begins.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the 7800 port of Rampart that is currently available is in an early state and not complete in terms of gameplay or graphics, which is immediately obvious by the lack of a proper title screen. Rampart requires a two-button 7800 joystick. You can select difficulty and number of players, including one player, two players, team or competition modes. Gameplay consists of shooting the enemy targets, which appear as \"NME\" graphics. The left joystick button fires your normal weapon. The right fire button will destroy all enemies onscreen. If you choose a two player game (team or competition), both players can shoot at enemy targets. There are several different playfield backgrounds depending on the game type selected, or if you play additional games.\r\n\r\nA partially compiled version of Rampart was discovered by Curt Vendel, and thanks to the efforts 7800 enthusiasts Robert DeCrescenzo, Mitchell Orman, and Eckhard Stolberg, made playable on 7800 hardware. Internal Atari memos from 1993 mention that the game is almost finalized, so a more complete version of the game must exist somewhere.","Co-op":"No","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"12","Game":[{"id":"16298","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"16296","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"27036","PlatformId":"4924"},{"id":"16295","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"2037","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"16293","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"16294","PlatformId":"41"},{"id":"16297","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"4587","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"11522","PlatformId":"35"},{"id":"16292","PlatformId":"12"},{"id":"5804","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/22384-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"524","height":"700","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/22384-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-2.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-3.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-4.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-5.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-6.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-6.jpg"}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/22384.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"117"}}}},"RealSports Baseball":{"id":"21055","GameTitle":"RealSports Baseball","PlatformId":"27","Platform":"Atari 7800","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1988","Overview":"You smell the freshly cut grass as you walk out of the dark, cool tunnel into the hot afternoon sun.

Now Earth is threatened by deadly aliens and you must use your creation to save the planet. The Sentinel absorbs energy from every power pod or energy capsule you shoot with your Atari light gun. When an energy source is hit, a beam blasts out from the Sentinel, strikes the target with hissing force, and draws energy back into your Sentinel. It's up to you to protect the Sentinel as it glides over the planets.\r\n\r\nThis was the only game for the 7800 that was originally released in PAL format only. Thanks to ResQsoft, an NTSC version is also available for gamers in the Western Hemisphere. Sentinel is a light gun game that is similar to Crossbow in the aspect that you are in charge of protecting your ally, in this case the Sentinel, from attack. The game features four stages, each which its own name and level boss. What makes the game unique is that shooting the large orange Sentinel acts as a smart bomb, destroying everything on the screen.

To do this, you will need to blast your way through their defenses on three levels of increasing difficulty.

You start the game with four skiers, and the game ends when all of you skiers have crashed.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Froggo Games Corporation","Developer":"Froggo Games Corporation","Rating":"6.5","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/22390-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"640","height":"884","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/22390-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/22390-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"877","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/22390-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-2.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-3.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-4.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-5.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-6.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-6.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-7.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-7.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-8.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-8.jpg"}]}},"Winter Games":{"id":"20610","GameTitle":"Winter Games","PlatformId":"27","Platform":"Atari 7800","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1987","Overview":"You're an athlete at the 1988 Winter Games at Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
