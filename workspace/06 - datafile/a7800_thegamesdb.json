AtariAge user Mitch recently acquired the only known prototype of this game to exist and has graciously shared the binary with the community so everyone may enjoy it. Missing in Action is based on the 1984 movie of the same name, featuring Chuck Norris as the protagonist. The game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up, taking place in Vietnam during the height of the Vietnam War. As Colonel James Braddock, a captured POW, your mission is to escape from an internment camp, rescue captured POWs, free the American embassy, and kill the evil drug czar. Had it been completed, Missing in Action would have been an impressive addition to the 7800 library.

Your goal in the arcade version of the game is to build up a castle using pieces to form a wall around your territory. After your castle is built, you then place cannons and use them to fire at enemy ships or another player's castle. After each round you then have an opportunity to rebuild your castle before the next round begins.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the 7800 port of Rampart that is currently available is in an early state and not complete in terms of gameplay or graphics, which is immediately obvious by the lack of a proper title screen. Rampart requires a two-button 7800 joystick. You can select difficulty and number of players, including one player, two players, team or competition modes. Gameplay consists of shooting the enemy targets, which appear as \"NME\" graphics. The left joystick button fires your normal weapon. The right fire button will destroy all enemies onscreen. If you choose a two player game (team or competition), both players can shoot at enemy targets. There are several different playfield backgrounds depending on the game type selected, or if you play additional games.\r\n\r\nA partially compiled version of Rampart was discovered by Curt Vendel, and thanks to the efforts 7800 enthusiasts Robert DeCrescenzo, Mitchell Orman, and Eckhard Stolberg, made playable on 7800 hardware. Internal Atari memos from 1993 mention that the game is almost finalized, so a more complete version of the game must exist somewhere.","Co-op":"No","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"12","Game":[{"id":"16298","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"16296","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"27036","PlatformId":"4924"},{"id":"16295","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"2037","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"16293","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"16294","PlatformId":"41"},{"id":"16297","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"4587","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"11522","PlatformId":"35"},{"id":"16292","PlatformId":"12"},{"id":"5804","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/22384-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"524","height":"700","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/22384-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-2.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-3.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-4.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-5.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22384-6.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22384-6.jpg"}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/22384.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"117"}}}},"Raster Music Tracker (PD)":{},"RealSports Baseball ":{"id":"21055","GameTitle":"RealSports Baseball","PlatformId":"27","Platform":"Atari 7800","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1988","Overview":"You smell the freshly cut grass as you walk out of the dark, cool tunnel into the hot afternoon sun.

Now Earth is threatened by deadly aliens and you must use your creation to save the planet. The Sentinel absorbs energy from every power pod or energy capsule you shoot with your Atari light gun. When an energy source is hit, a beam blasts out from the Sentinel, strikes the target with hissing force, and draws energy back into your Sentinel. It's up to you to protect the Sentinel as it glides over the planets.\r\n\r\nThis was the only game for the 7800 that was originally released in PAL format only. Thanks to ResQsoft, an NTSC version is also available for gamers in the Western Hemisphere. Sentinel is a light gun game that is similar to Crossbow in the aspect that you are in charge of protecting your ally, in this case the Sentinel, from attack. The game features four stages, each which its own name and level boss. What makes the game unique is that shooting the large orange Sentinel acts as a smart bomb, destroying everything on the screen. While Sentinel is a very hard title to find in the wild in the Americas, this game is pretty common in Europe and can normally be purchased through online auctions at a reasonable price.","Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Atari","Developer":"Atari","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/22386-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"600","height":"827","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/22386-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/22386-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"524","height":"700","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/22386-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-2.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-3.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-4.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-5.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-6.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-6.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-7.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-7.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-8.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-8.jpg"}]}},"Sirius ":{},"Small Sprite Demo 2 - Animations by Heaven_TQA (V20040117) (PD)":{},"Small Sprite Demo by Heaven_TQA (V20040117) (PD)":{},"Space Duel":{},"Space Invaders 7800":{"id":"28406","GameTitle":"Space Invaders","PlatformId":"27","Platform":"Atari 7800","ReleaseDate":"01/01/2008","Overview":"Space Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens.

The game features six different levels, each with its own unique theme and boss. Only three of these levels are unique graphically--the other three are just color palette changes. Plutos offers one player as well as two player simultaneous modes, selectable with the left difficulty switch. Plutos also has features a unique weapons power-up system. There are three different types of weapons, each of which can be upgraded up to four times, as well as an invincibility power-up. The three different weapons are: Dual machine guns, spread gun, and energy gun.\r\n\r\nA partially compiled version of Plutos was discovered by Curt Vendel, and thanks to the efforts 7800 enthusiasts Robert DeCrescenzo, Mitchell Orman, and Eckhard Stolberg, made playable on 7800 hardware.

Gameplay consists of shooting the enemy targets, which appear as \"NME\" graphics. The left joystick button fires your normal weapon. The right fire button will destroy all enemies onscreen.

Sentinel is a light gun game that is similar to Crossbow in the aspect that you are in charge of protecting your ally, in this case the Sentinel, from attack. The game features four stages, each which its own name and level boss. What makes the game unique is that shooting the large orange Sentinel acts as a smart bomb, destroying everything on the screen. While Sentinel is a very hard title to find in the wild in the Americas, this game is pretty common in Europe and can normally be purchased through online auctions at a reasonable price.","Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Atari","Developer":"Atari","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/22386-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"600","height":"827","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/22386-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/22386-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"524","height":"700","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/22386-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-2.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-3.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-4.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-5.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-6.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-6.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-7.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-7.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22386-8.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22386-8.jpg"}]}},"Sirius":{"id":"22387","GameTitle":"Sirius","PlatformId":"27","Platform":"Atari 7800","Overview":"Sirius is a long lost unreleased prototype developed by Tynesoft for the Atari 7800, possibly a port of the 1990 Amiga game Sirius 7. Sirius' existence has been known for some time, as a physical prototype has been in hands of a collector for years, but this prototype was known to be unstable and crash frequently. The source code for Sirius was discovered in 2008 and several 7800 enthusiasts were able to get it compiled and running properly on stock 7800 hardware.\r\n\r\nSirius is a horizontally oriented space shooter that will feel right at home to those familiar with games such as Gradius and R-Type. The game consists of four different levels, each with its own unique theme and boss. Sirius deftly demonstrates what the 7800 hardware is capable of and compares favorably with NES and Sega Master System games of the time. Unfortunately, Sirius is aggravatingly difficult and will require much practice and patience to succeed through all four levels.\r\n\r\nSirius is a single player game only. The difficulty level (easy and hard) can be selected via the left difficulty switch. Sirius has several different types of weapons power-ups. The first is a \"ghost ship\" that follows you and fires when you fire. Other power-ups include rapid fire guns and rapid fire plus spread fire. You can pick up one extra of each power-up type for reserve so that when you are killed you won't be quite so vulnerable. There are also diamonds that you can pick up but they don't seem to do much other than reward you 300 points.\r\n\r\nA partially compiled version of Sirius was discovered by Curt Vendel, and thanks to the efforts 7800 enthusiasts Robert DeCrescenzo, Mitchell Orman, and Eckhard Stolberg, made playable on 7800 hardware. It's a shame that Sirius was not released as it was obviously very close to completion and would have been a boost to the 7800 library.","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Never Published (Prototype)","Developer":"Tynesoft","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/22387-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"524","height":"700","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/22387-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22387-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"450"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22387-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22387-2.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22387-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22387-3.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22387-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22387-4.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22387-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22387-5.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22387-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22387-6.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"450"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22387-6.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22387-7.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"450"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22387-7.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22387-8.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22387-8.jpg"}]}},"Summer Games":{"id":"21058","GameTitle":"Summer Games","PlatformId":"27","Platform":"Atari 7800","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1987","Overview":"Experience the power, the glory, the thrill and the challenge of the world's greatest athletic competition: the SUMMER GAMES!\r\n\r\nThe awe-inspiring OPENING CEREMONY focuses on 3,000 years of noble tradition as you proudly look on, ready to give your very best to honor your country.\r\n\r\nThis is the moment you've worked and trained so long to achieve, to test your skill under pressure against the best of the world's athletes.

You control a tank on a mission to capture the enemy flag as well as earn as many points as possible. To do this, you will need to blast your way through their defenses on three levels of increasing difficulty. Blocking your progress are enemy tanks, pillboxes, missiles, jeeps, infantry, huts, and more, all of which earn you points when destroyed. Your tank is equipped with a limited amount of fuel and ammo, however it can be replenished occasionally by collecting the bonus icons when they appear on the screen. If you can make it past all of the obstacles and capture the flag, then you win the game!\r\n\r\nThe 7800 is pretty much void of super-rare games like the 2600'?s Tooth Protectors and Chase the Chuckwagon, but don't worry, tracking down Tank Command in a box will cost you a pretty penny. As far as gameplay goes, Tank Command is not going to blow anyone away. Here you have a vertical scroller like Commando or Ikari Warriors minus the charm, quality level design, and reasonable difficulty. There are only three levels in the game, but just like its Froggo cousin Water Ski, the difficulty ramps so severely after the mindless first level that continuing takes strong will.

You control both the boat and skier in this vertically scrolling action game. Your goal is to reach the finish line before time runs out and also to earn as many points as possible. The river is quite dangerous, and features many twists and turns along with rocks, logs and other obstacles. For bonus points there are numerous ramps located throughout the river which your skier can jump over (and if you can manage to ski over every ramp on the level, you'll earn even more points!). You start the game with four skiers, and the game ends when all of you skiers have crashed.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Froggo Games Corporation","Developer":"Froggo Games Corporation","Rating":"6.5","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/22390-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"640","height":"884","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/22390-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/22390-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"877","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/22390-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-2.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-3.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-4.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-5.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-6.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-6.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-7.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-7.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22390-8.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"446"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22390-8.jpg"}]}},"Winter Games":{"id":"20610","GameTitle":"Winter Games","PlatformId":"27","Platform":"Atari 7800","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1987","Overview":"You're an athlete at the 1988 Winter Games at Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
