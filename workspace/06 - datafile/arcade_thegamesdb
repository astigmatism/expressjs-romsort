Some screens feature protective walls (which can get damaged and shattered by enemy fire). The players have limitless ammunition for their primary gun, but a limited number of sticks of dynamite, with which they must fend off enemy troops. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structural features of the screen (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage, reprising the amusing \\\"victory dance walk\\\" into the horizon from Cabal. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies.\\r\\n\\r\\nPower-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen or special characters who may run across, such as the small Indian Chief figure or warthogs. Points and weaponry can also be dispensed from the tin can, if you shoot it into the air and juggle it with subsequent shots.

You, as Blue, are a specialist of the Leaf Dump, and you love Princess Fa of the Raguy family. Unfortunately, Princess Fa has fallen sick from the pollution. It's your job to save your princess in Blue's Journey, a 2D side-scrolling platformer with RPG elements. Go through stages jumping on platforms and avoiding traps, while dealing with a multitude of bad guys, with a special bad guy boss at the end of every level to defeat with special means. To help with this, Blue can use a leaf attack and shrink. The leaf attack, only used when Blue is full sized, lets Blue slam a leaf that stuns any enemies he hits. Blue can also pick up power-ups for a more devastating leaf attack, or change his attack entirely. When the enemies are stunned, Blue can pick them up and throw them across the screen to dispose of more baddies. Shrunken down Blue can't use his attacking power, but he can fit into small crevasses and crannies not normally accessible. Of course, Blue can also dispatch enemies by jumping on them. Since Raguy's economy is flower based, Blue can collect flowers to buy things at special huts. But Blue must take care not to fall into traps or bottomless pits, which cause instant death. Being hit by bad guys or their shots is just as bad. Blue starts the game with two hearts, losing one when he gets whacked by a bad guy. When his heart count goes to zero, Blue dies.

Both the pistol and additional weapons have only a limited amount of ammunition, and if players runs out of ammo, they will only be able to punch or \\\"somersault attack\\\" into attacking enemies. Each stage features numerous background items that can be used to attack enemies, such as wooden barrels, boxes and hanging lights. When shot, some criminals drop packets of illegal drugs, which can be picked up for bonus points.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrime City's gameplay takes its inspiration from both Namco's \\\"Rolling Thunder\\\" and Sega's \\\"Shinobi\\\".\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"Yes\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGpNWSWscAk\",\"Publisher\":\"Taito\",\"Developer\":\"Taito\",\"Rating\":\"6.5\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"2\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"22717\",\"PlatformId\":\"4916\"},{\"id\":\"35438\",\"PlatformId\":\"1\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/2437-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"850\",\"height\":\"1098\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/2437-1.jpg\"}},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/2437.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"88\"}}}}","Crime Fighters ":"{\"id\":\"26919\",\"GameTitle\":\"Crime Fighters\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"04/01/1989\",\"Overview\":\"Crime Fighters is a beat-em up arcade game where your job is to rescue several women that have been kidnapped by a crime boss and clean up the streets by pummeling as many gang members as possible with your bare hands, as well as anything else you might possibly discover.

It is an early example of the platform game genre, as the gameplay focuses on maneuvering the main character across a series of platforms while dodging and jumping over obstacles. In the game, Jumpman (since renamed Mario) must rescue a damsel in distress, Lady (now named Pauline) from a giant ape named Donkey Kong. The hero and ape later became two of Nintendo's most popular characters.\\r\\nThe game was the latest in a series of efforts by Nintendo to break into the North American market. Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo's president at the time, assigned the project to a first-time game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. Drawing from a wide range of inspirations, including Popeye, Beauty and the Beast and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo's chief engineer, Gunpei Yokoi. The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including cut scenes to advance the game's plot, and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.\\r\\nDespite initial misgivings on the part of Nintendo's American staff, Donkey Kong proved a success in North America and Japan. Nintendo licensed the game to Coleco, who developed home console versions for numerous platforms. Other companies cloned Nintendo's hit and avoided royalties altogether. Miyamoto's characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, and dozens of other places. A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging Donkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately failed. The success of Donkey Kong and Nintendo's win in the courtroom helped position the company to dominate the video game market from its release in 1981, until the mid 1990s.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Platform\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24OcmpZ6fA\",\"Publisher\":\"Nintendo\",\"Developer\":\"Nintendo\",\"Rating\":\"8.6667\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"16\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"52961\",\"PlatformId\":\"4911\"},{\"id\":\"28268\",\"PlatformId\":\"4914\"},{\"id\":\"2876\",\"PlatformId\":\"22\"},{\"id\":\"5154\",\"PlatformId\":\"26\"},{\"id\":\"4898\",\"PlatformId\":\"27\"},{\"id\":\"50417\",\"PlatformId\":\"4943\"},{\"id\":\"4000\",\"PlatformId\":\"31\"},{\"id\":\"6902\",\"PlatformId\":\"40\"},{\"id\":\"45236\",\"PlatformId\":\"4936\"},{\"id\":\"4063\",\"PlatformId\":\"32\"},{\"id\":\"49483\",\"PlatformId\":\"4912\"},{\"id\":\"5\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\"},{\"id\":\"3174\",\"PlatformId\":\"4\"},{\"id\":\"36374\",\"PlatformId\":\"38\"},{\"id\":\"29641\",\"PlatformId\":\"4913\"},{\"id\":\"37802\",\"PlatformId\":\"4953\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/7862-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"850\",\"height\":\"1099\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/7862-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/7862-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"850\",\"height\":\"1098\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/7862-1.jpg\"}}],\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/7862-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"599\",\"height\":\"597\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/7862-1.jpg\"},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/7862.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"80\"}}}}","Donkey Kong 3 ":"{\"id\":\"3089\",\"GameTitle\":\"Donkey Kong 3\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"10/05/1983\",\"Overview\":\"Stanley is a bugman.

Each character has a set of moves in addition to two basic punches and kicks. Each character also has a super move called a \\\"Danger Move\\\", which are similar to the Desperation Moves from Fatal Fury 2. Players also have the ability to taunt others, but unlike games such as Art of Fighting, this has no effect and would actually leave the player open to attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two bonus games that reward the player with points dependent on how successful the player is. The first game is a brick-breaking game that requires rapid pressing of the A button.

When one is selected, the player must use it to destroy other robots in each planet. Other than the playable characters, there are several non-playable characters and bosses with original designs and unique movesets. In the final battle, the player will face the same character he or she chose.

When the player loses all of his or her lives, the game is over and it returns to attract mode. In each battle, the timer starts at one minute and thirty seconds, and when it drops to zero before any player is knocked out, the player with the least amount of damage wins. Players can monitor this by looking at their life bars. At the start of the fight, both players life bars are blue, but as the fight progresses, the life bar changes to a pink color for the player with the least amount of health remaining or most damage taken.

It is the sequel to Galaxian, released in 1979. The gameplay of Galaga puts the player in control of a space ship which is situated on the bottom of the screen. At the beginning of each stage, the area is empty, but over time, enemy aliens fly in formation, and once all of the enemies arrive on screen, they will come down at the player's ship in formations of one or more and may either shoot it or collide with it. During the entire stage, the player may fire upon the enemies, and once all enemies are vanquished, the player moves onto the next stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nGalaga has proven very successful. The arcade version of it has been ported to many consoles, and it has had several sequels, most recently Galaga Legions for the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade services.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying insect-like enemies. The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.\\r\\n\\r\\nGalaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's \\\"hit/miss ratio\\\" at the end of the game, and a bonus \\\"Challenging Stage\\\" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Shooter\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29VVkfuXkVI\",\"Publisher\":\"Midway\",\"Developer\":\"Namco\",\"Rating\":\"8\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"6\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"44093\",\"PlatformId\":\"22\"},{\"id\":\"4899\",\"PlatformId\":\"27\"},{\"id\":\"45342\",\"PlatformId\":\"4936\"},{\"id\":\"50334\",\"PlatformId\":\"15\"},{\"id\":\"35838\",\"PlatformId\":\"4929\"},{\"id\":\"1834\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\"}]},\"Images\":{\"fanart\":[{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/7861-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/7861-1.jpg\"},{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/7861-2.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/7861-2.jpg\"}],\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/7861-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"850\",\"height\":\"1103\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/7861-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/7861-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"850\",\"height\":\"1103\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/7861-1.jpg\"}}],\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/7861-2.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"640\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/7861-2.jpg\"},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/7861.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"193\"}}}}","Galaga '88 ":"{\"id\":\"12262\",\"GameTitle\":\"Galaga '88\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"12/01/1987\",\"Overview\":\"The gameplay in Galaga '88 is built on the same premise as that of the original Galaga game, but is in many ways more complex and more difficult. The game is divided into a series of 29 Stages distributed through eight Worlds. The starship Galaga accelerates between Stages and Worlds and even to higher dimensions (go to the section on Dimensional Travel below to find out more).\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the exception of the third and eighth, each World culminates in a Challenging Stage. There are six such stages to engage in any full game, and each begins with the on-screen announcement \\\"That's Galactic Dancin'!\\\" and has its own YM2151-generated song to which the enemy formations dance. In any given Challenging Stage, both the design of the enemies and their dancing formations shall vary according to the player's current Dimension. As in Galaga, the objective is to destroy all forty enemies before they fly away off the screen. However, refraining completely from touching any controls for the duration of a Challenging Stage awards a \\\"secret bonus\\\" ranging in value from 10000 to 25000 points, and equal to the \\\"special bonus\\\" which would have been awarded for destroying all forty enemy aliens instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nGalaga '88 introduces a variety of new enemies and behaviors. Most of these special enemies are worth varying amounts of bonus points when destroyed. Some enemies can combine into larger enemies which take multiple hits to destroy, while others arrive in eggs, explode in a shower of fireworks, grow with multiple hits, or sport armor which makes them invincible while in formation. Certain enemies drop small formations of tiny creatures that wiggle their way down the screen, and still others can act as escorts to incoming groups of enemies and then quickly dive at the player before leaving the game. Most stages also include various obstacles which appear once the enemy formation has been assembled. These can be destroyed with either one or several shots, and the first one on each stage will leave a \\\"Warp Capsule\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the start of the game, the player can select how many Galaga starships to start with (one or two), affecting their number of remaining lives. The game ends after the final boss is defeated (or when the player's last ship is destroyed or captured) - in the latter case, the player can continue the game for an additional credit. The Game Over screen shows the player's hit-miss ratio and a visual representation of their progress. If the player reaches Stage 27, the game also shows a picture of the final boss (damaged if defeated, but silhouetted if not). If the arcade operator has set the \\\"continue\\\" option to \\\"on\\\", the player also cannot continue if he is defeated on Stages 27-29.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Shooter\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axaTy45jAqk\",\"Publisher\":\"Namco\",\"Developer\":\"Namco\",\"Rating\":\"7\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"1\",\"Game\":{\"id\":\"26215\",\"PlatformId\":\"34\"}},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/12262-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"850\",\"height\":\"1193\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/12262-1.jpg\"}},\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/12262-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"160\",\"height\":\"205\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/12262-1.jpg\"},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/12262.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"217\"}}}}","Galaxian ":"{\"id\":\"7866\",\"GameTitle\":\"Galaxian\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"10/01/1979\",\"Overview\":\"Galaxian expanded on the formula pioneered by Space Invaders.

The game starts in a fictional solar system with several planets to explore. If the player moves his ship into a planet, he will be taken to a side-view landscape. Unlike many other shooting games, gravity plays a fair part in Gravitar: the ship will be pulled slowly to the deadly star in the overworld, and downward in the side-view levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe player has five buttons: two to rotate the ship left or right, one to shoot, one to activate the thruster, and one for both a tractor beam and force field. Gravitar, Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe and Space Duel all used similar 5-button controlling system.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the side-view levels, the player has to destroy red bunkers that shoot constantly, and can also use the tractor beam to pick up blue fuel tanks. Once all of the bunkers are destroyed, the planet will blow up, and the player will earn a bonus. Once all planets are destroyed, the player will move onto another solar system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe player will lose a life if he crashes into the terrain or gets hit by an enemy's shot, and the game will end immediately if fuel runs out.\\r\\n\\r\\nGravitar has 12 different planets. Red Planet is available in all 3 phases in the universe; it contains a reactor. Shooting the reactor core activates a link. Escaping the reactor successfully moves the player to the next phase of planets, awards bonus points and 7500 units of fuel. Reactor escape time reduces after each phase and eventually becomes virtually impossible to complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter completing all 11 planets (or alternatively completing the reactor three times) the player enters the second universe and the gravity will reverse. Instead of dragging the ship towards the planet surface, the gravity pushes it away. In the third universe the landscape becomes invisible and the gravity is positive again. The final, fourth universe, has invisible landscape and reverse gravity. After completing the fourth universe the game starts over. However, the reactor escape time will never reset back to high levels again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe programmers thought that even the best players could never complete the most difficult planets on the invisible levels.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Shooter\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Atari\",\"Developer\":\"Atari\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"1\",\"Game\":{\"id\":\"1348\",\"PlatformId\":\"22\"}},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/35479-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"800\",\"height\":\"1116\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/35479-1.jpg\"}},\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/35479-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"480\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/35479-1.jpg\"}}}","Great 1000 Miles Rally":"{\"id\":\"12265\",\"GameTitle\":\"Great 1000 Mile Rally\",\"AlternateTitles\":{\"title\":\"1000 Miglia: Great 1000 Miles Rally\"},\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"06/01/1994\",\"Overview\":\"A driving game with top-down pseudo 3-D graphics.

In the game, the player controls two green men who carry a cannon, as they defend the king below them from getting abducted by the balloons above, which keep invading the lower part of the screen while also shooting projectiles. Once all the balloons are shot down, the game moves on to the next level.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing that makes King & Balloon unique is that you don't lose a life when hit. Rather, you respawn and keep on playing. The only way to lose a life is letting the king get abducted. Another interesting mechanic of note is that the balloons stop attacking and descending when one grabs ahold of the king, and they will keep still until the king is back on the ground. This creates a risk versus reward mechanic and entices you to let the balloon carry the king high enough so you can take out more balloons, then rescuing the king just in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing & Balloon was also one of the first games to have speech synthesis, and it still holds up better than most contemporary or even later examples. The king says \\\"Help!\\\" when abducted, \\\"Thank You!\\\" when rescued, and \\\"Bye bye!\\\" when he leaves the screen.

Atari Games originally released it as a coin-op follow up to Tetris, about which they were tangled in a legal dispute at the time.\\r\\n     Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen. It constantly rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area, which can be moved left and right to catch the blocks and deposit them either in the playing area (which can hold 25 blocks in a 5x5 arrangement) or push them back up the conveyor belt. The device can hold up to five blocks. An uncaught block is considered a \\\"drop\\\". A flashing block can be used as a wildcard on any color. In the playing area, blocks can be eliminated by arranging three or more of the same color into a continuous line, known as a \\\"Klax.\\\" The line may be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. A multiple grouping (e.g., one vertical and horizontal) counts as multiple Klaxes, as does Klaxes of four same-colored blocks (two Klaxes) or five same-colored blocks (three Klaxes). Once the goal is reached, bonus points are awarded for remaining blocks on the conveyor belt and device, and empty spaces in the bin (also, on levels where a certain point total is required, points in excess of the required amount are counted both in the scoring and as bonus points).\\r\\n     Klax consists of 100 levels grouped into blocks of five. At the beginning of the game and after each fifth level (levels divisible by five, except for Levels 95 and 100), a player can choose to skip five or ten levels.

It was developed by Shigeru Miyamoto. \\r\\n\\r\\nMario Bros. features two plumbers, Mario and Luigi, having to investigate the sewers of New York after strange creatures have been appearing down there. The objective of the game is to defeat all of the enemies in each phase. The mechanics of Mario Bros. involve only running and jumping. Unlike future Mario games, players cannot jump on enemies and squash them, unless they were already turned on their back. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen (in the old version along with an object called a \\\"POW\\\" block in the center). Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right and vice versa.\\r\\nThe player gains points by defeating multiple enemies consecutively and can participate in a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has a certain number of enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing its speed to maximum. There are three enemies in all: the Shellcreeper, which simply walks around; the Sidestepper, which requires two hits to flip over; and the Fighter Fly, which moves by jumping and can only be flipped when it is touching a platform. Players may also make use of the above-mentioned \\\"POW\\\" block, which flips any enemy touching a platform or the floor when a player hits it from below. This item can be used three times before it disappears. Coins appear whenever enemies are defeated and may be collected for bonus points.\\r\\nAs the game progresses, elements are added to increase the difficulty. Fireballs either bounce around the screen or travel directly from one side to the other, and Slipices can freeze platforms, causing Mario and Luigi to skid. In addition, icicles start to form under the platforms and fall loose. Bonus rounds give the players a chance to score extra points by collecting coins without having to deal with enemies; the \\\"POW\\\" block regenerates itself on each of these screens.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"Yes\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly8DofqCuOs\",\"Publisher\":\"Nintendo\",\"Developer\":\"Nintendo\",\"Rating\":\"7\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"6\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"5309\",\"PlatformId\":\"22\"},{\"id\":\"5178\",\"PlatformId\":\"26\"},{\"id\":\"21047\",\"PlatformId\":\"27\"},{\"id\":\"6395\",\"PlatformId\":\"40\"},{\"id\":\"189\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\"},{\"id\":\"48903\",\"PlatformId\":\"38\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/16258-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"850\",\"height\":\"1201\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/16258-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/16258-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"850\",\"height\":\"1199\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/16258-1.jpg\"}}],\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/16258-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"256\",\"height\":\"224\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/16258-1.jpg\"}}}","Mars":"{\"id\":\"38797\",\"GameTitle\":\"Mars\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"10/01/1981\",\"Overview\":\"The player pilots a sputnik-shaped spaceship over a leftward scrolling landscape.

The players are members of a covert mercenary team known as the \\\"Wolf Force\\\". The team is composed of Joseph Gibson (Player 1 in blue), Howard Powell (Player 2 in red), and Thomas Clarke (Player 3 in yellow). Their objective is to rescue a former President from rebels in the fictional African country of Zutula, which is administered by an apartheid government. The game has six levels, plus the final level where the objective is to rescue the president from the Hercules Transport.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe controls consist of an eight-directional joystick and two buttons: a Normal Attack and the Megacrush Attack. The player character has a vitality gauge which will gradually deplete as they take damage from enemies, however First-Aid Kits can be picked up that will restore part of the player's energy, as well as power-ups that increases their maximum vitality. The player can upgrade their default gun into an Assault Rifle, a Shotgun, a Grenade Launcher, or a Flamethrower. The Megacrush button will detonate a bomb that kills all on-screen enemies. However, the Megacrush Attack has limited uses which the player can only replenish by picking more Megacrush bombs.

The title character, Mr. Do (a circus clown—except for the original Japanese version of the game in which he is a snowman. See flyer image at right of this text), is constantly chased by red monsters resembling small dinosaurs, and the player loses a life if Mr. Do is caught by one. The game is over when the last life is lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nCherries are distributed throughout the level in groups of eight. 500 bonus points are awarded if Mr. Do collects eight cherries in a row without stopping. A level is complete when all cherries are removed, all monsters are destroyed, \\\"EXTRA\\\" is spelled, or a diamond is found.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Do can defeat the monsters by hitting them with his bouncing \\\"power ball\\\" or by dropping large apples on them. While the power ball is bouncing toward a monster, Mr. Do is defenseless. If the ball bounces into an area where there are no monsters to hit (such as behind a fallen apple), Mr. Do cannot use it again until he has retrieved it. When the power ball hits a monster, it then reforms in Mr. Do's hands after a delay that increases with each use.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Do or the red monsters can push an apple off the edge of a vertical tunnel and crush one or more monsters. If an apple falls more than its own height, it breaks and disappears. Mr. Do can also be crushed by a falling apple causing a loss of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally, the red monsters transform briefly into more powerful multicolored monsters that can tunnel through the ground. If one of these digs through a cherry, it leaves fewer cherries (and fewer points) for Mr. Do to collect. When it digs under an apple, it often crushes itself, other red/blue monsters, and/or Mr. Do.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach time the score passes a certain threshold during play (5000 points), a letter from the word \\\"EXTRA\\\" appears on the playfield as an Alphamonster, and the player can defeat or be defeated by this monster in the same way as a red monster. Defeating an Alphamonster awards that letter to the player, and collecting all five letters of the word completes the level, plays a cut scene inexplicably playing the theme to Astro Boy, and awards the player an extra life. Alphamonsters attempt to eat any apples they encounter, which makes them difficult (but not impossible) to crush.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe red monsters spawn at the center of the screen. After they have all appeared, the generator will turn into a food item; picking this up scores bonus points, freezes all the red monsters, and calls out an Alphamonster and three large blue monsters. The latter can eat apples as well. The red monsters stay frozen (but still deadly) until the player either defeats all three blue monsters, defeats the Alphamonster (in which case any remaining blue monsters are turned into apples), loses a life, or completes the stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nRarely, dropping an apple will reveal a diamond which, if collected within about 15 seconds, completes the level and awards a bonus credit to the player (as well as 8000 points), allowing him or her to play a free game.

Most of the items are fruits from the original Pac-Man game, with a few new additions. Their value varies, starting with cherries at 50 points, and ending with keys from 700 to 5000 points. The items had to first be unlocked by turning over cards distributed around the maze (instead of eating keys like in Super Pac-Man).

In each of these trips the objective is to get the fairy (that is kept under Pac-man's hat) to Fairyland and also to return home to Pac-Man's house. The majority of the trip involves moving from left to right avoiding various obstacles such as the enemy ghosts, water spurts and quicksand traps. Each trip is divided into a number of rounds, the end of which provides Pac-Man with bonus points depending on how much time he has left and also his position in jumping at the end of each round. If the player runs out of time before finishing the round, Sue, the purple ghost, will speed up rapidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe penultimate round of a trip ends with Pac-Man entering Fairyland and returning the fairy under his hat to the Fairy Queen. In return the Fairy Queen gives Pac-Man magic boots. For the final round of the trip, Pac-Man has to travel from right to left back home. For assistance he uses the magic boots, which allow him to jump repeatedly while in mid-air. Once Pac-Man completes the trip, he is greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man. In the US release of the game, Pac-Man's cat and dog in the cartoon series, Sour Puss and Chomp-Chomp, are also there to welcome Pac-Man home.

It was developed by Amstar Electronics (which was located in Phoenix, Arizona) in 1980,[1] and released by Centuri in the United States and by Taito in Japan.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenix mothership is one of the first video arcade game bosses to be presented as a separate challenge.[4] This was before the term boss was coined.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe player controls a spaceship that moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen, firing upward. Enemies, typically one of two types of birds, appear on the screen above the player's ship, shooting at it and periodically diving towards it in an attempt to crash into it. The ship is equipped with a shield that can be used to zap any of the alien creatures that attempt to crash into the spaceship. The player cannot move while the shield is active and must wait approximately five seconds before using it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe player starts with three or six lives, depending on the settings.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach level has five separate rounds. The player must complete a round to advance to the next.\\r\\n\\r\\nRounds 1 and 2 – The player must destroy a formation of alien birds. While in formation, some of the birds fly down kamikaze style, in an attempt to destroy the player's spaceship by crashing into it. Hitting a bird flying diagonally awards a bonus score. The birds are yellow in round 1, pink in round 2. The player's spaceship is given rapid fire for round 2, where the birds fly somewhat more unpredictably. These rounds are highly reminiscent of Galaxian.\\r\\nRounds 3 and 4 – Flying eggs float on the screen and seconds later hatch, revealing larger alien birds, resembling phoenices, which swoop down at the player's spaceship. The only way to fully destroy one of these birds is by hitting it in its belly; shooting one of its wings merely destroys that wing, and if both wings are destroyed, they will regenerate. From time to time the birds may also revert to the egg form for a brief period. The birds are blue in round 3, pink in round 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mothership in Phoenix is one of the first bosses to appear in an arcade game.[4]\\r\\nRound 5 – The player is pitted against the mothership, which is controlled by an alien creature sitting in its center. To complete this round, the player must create a hole in the conveyor belt-type shield to get a clear shot at the alien. Hitting the alien with a single shot ends the level. The mothership fires missiles at the player, moves slowly down towards him, and has alien birds (from rounds 1 and 2) protecting the ship. Defeating all of the birds will produce a new wave.\\r\\nThe game continues with increasing speed and unpredictability of the bird and phoenix flights.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Shooter\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT-9ngaEvfc\",\"Publisher\":\"Centuri\",\"Developer\":\"Centuri\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"1\",\"Game\":{\"id\":\"10129\",\"PlatformId\":\"22\"}},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/27843-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"850\",\"height\":\"1094\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/27843-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/27843-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"850\",\"height\":\"1097\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/27843-1.jpg\"}}],\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/27843.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"120\"}}}}","Phozon":{},"Pickin'":{},"Pig Newton ":"{\"id\":\"45409\",\"GameTitle\":\"Pig Newton\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"05/01/1983\",\"Overview\":\"A pig fights against wolves.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Fighting\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HkMVSVKqcQ\",\"Publisher\":\"Sega\",\"Developer\":\"Sega\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/45409-1.png\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"224\",\"height\":\"256\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/45409-1.png\"}}}}","Pigout":{},"Pigskin 621AD":"{\"id\":\"12672\",\"GameTitle\":\"Pigskin 621AD\",\"AlternateTitles\":{\"title\":[\"Pigskin 621 A.D.\",\"Pigskin\"]},\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"10/01/1990\",\"Overview\":\"Play Football with Barbarians!

It is a tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as Computer Space came before it, Pong was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari Incorporated (Atari), which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nPong quickly became a success and is the first commercially successful arcade video game machine, which helped to establish the video game industry along with the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. Soon after its release, several companies began producing games that copied Pong '​s gameplay, and eventually released new types of games. As a result, Atari encouraged its staff to produce more innovative games. The company released several sequels that built upon the original's gameplay by adding new features. During the 1975 Christmas season, Atari released a home version of Pong exclusively through Sears retail stores. It was also a commercial success and led to numerous copies. The game has been remade on numerous home and portable platforms following its release. Pong has been referenced and parodied in multiple television shows and video games, and has been a part of several video game and cultural exhibitions.\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AAJBjEpsP4\",\"Publisher\":\"Atari\",\"Rating\":\"8.1667\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"3\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"36971\",\"PlatformId\":\"32\"},{\"id\":\"22904\",\"PlatformId\":\"4927\"},{\"id\":\"31095\",\"PlatformId\":\"10\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/7868-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"850\",\"height\":\"1108\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/7868-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/7868-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"850\",\"height\":\"1108\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/7868-1.jpg\"}}],\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/7868-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"388\",\"height\":\"240\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/7868-1.jpg\"}}}","Pioneer Balloon":"{\"id\":\"39265\",\"GameTitle\":\"Pioneer Balloon\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"10/01/1982\",\"Overview\":\"Guide a balloon across a variety of frontiers dropping bombs on your enemies.

Momotaro has no attacks of his own. However, he has the ability to grab barrels, drums, large bags, and various other items which he can throw (either horizontally or vertically) across the screen. Any pirate who stands in the way of a barrel or other object will be hurled off the screen. Barrels that impact the walls of a stage or other barrels or objects will shatter and produce points, while other objects are invulnerable (but do not produce points). Each successive enemy that is hit by a barrel will yield additional points once the barrel is destroyed. In addition, there are also various items hidden beneath barrels in each level which will give Momotaro bonus points. Every floor of the ship has a set number of pirates to be destroyed, as well as a single \\\"Bow\\\", a special pirate that regenerates each time it is defeated. Every fourth level in the game yields a bonus level in which the barrels are worth an increased number of points, and a group of enemies entirely made up of Bows (which do not regenerate in this case). With each successive floor, the speed and intelligence of the pirates increases. For every sixteen barrels Momotaro destroys, he will be rewarded with an item that grants invincibility for a limited amount of time, allowing him to defeat enemies by simply touching them. Momotaro's enemies do not have attacks, but a single touch from an enemy will cause him to die and be revived, costing the player one of his/her extra lives; the game will be over when he or she has no more lives.

It is also cited by some as a possible point of origin for the Polybius myth. Poly Play ran on a U880, a clone of the Zilog Z80 CPU, which was clocked at 2.457600 MHz and a custom sound chip. Its display ran at a resolution of 512*256 at 50 Hz and supported a palette of ten colours, though it could also use coloured overlays. The machine's coin slot was designed for 50 Pfennig, but it was flawed - the pressure sensor could be deceived by pressing a 1-Pfennig coin very sharply into the top of the slot. However, this was largely tolerated because the machine was not a capitalistic commercial venture, but a state-owned product found predominantly in FDGB holiday homes, youth hostels and non-profit clubs. The machine ran with a deactivated coin slot in many youth clubs. However, the free play often caused large crowds to form around it, which incited their reactivation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Poly Play machine was on display in the Museum of Computing in Swindon, England in 2004. From 2005, the same machine was part of the touring video game show Game On and was exhibited in multiple museums, such as the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago and the Science Museum in London. Two machines can also be seen at RetroGames e.V. in Germany. It is also prominently on display at the Computerspielemuseum Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nGAMES.\\r\\nHirschjagd (Deer Hunt) is similar to Robotron: 2084.\\r\\nTranslation from the game: The fleeing deer must be pursued and hunted, but only 10 shots are available. A shot that hits the deer is not deducted. Around every 15 seconds, a shot must be fired or it will be lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nHase und Wolf (Hare and Wolf) is a faster-paced Pac-Man clone and was based on the Russian cartoon series Nu, pogodi!, popular in the GDR.\\r\\nThe Hare must eat everything that it can get. It has to avoid the Wolf, who wants to eat it! Scoring: Pea 1 point, carrot 5 points, pear 7 and/or 10 points\\r\\n\\r\\nAbfahrtslauf (Downhill) is a simple sport game in which one must ski between the flags. The gates go from 6 metres wide, half the screen size (very easy) down to 0.2 metres (impossible). This game can become very fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchmetterlinge (Butterflies) with Pittiplatsch or Mole, both stars of children's television series in the GDR; however, the game is more suited to adults. The flowers act as obstacles that must be traversed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchießbude (Shooting Gallery) is a Carnival clone.\\r\\nShoot to score. A balloon gives you one point; a duck, two; and a flower, three. Ammunition can be reloaded by shooting into the left magazine. For each of the three rows there is, in the top right, a multiplier field to hit (coloured yellow, blue and pink). The longer one plays, the greater the number of ducks to emerge; ducks in the lowest row can steal one's ammunition if not dealt with quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutorennen (Motor Race) is a racing game. The player's red car must win 2 out of 4 rounds. It is not a very difficult game as you start in a good initial position and can pass the first curve more easily than the other racers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerkspiel (Memory Game) Remember all pictures and reveal them, playing against time. Each picture also has its own sound. If you forget a picture, its sound plays.\\r\\n\\r\\nWasserrohrbruch (Water Pipe Burst) This is the last Poly Play game. The objective is to prevent a room from flooding.\\r\\nIn the room above, a water pipe bursts. By catching drops with the bucket, you can prevent the water level from rising. The bucket can be emptied out of the cellar windows (play button). If the bucket is full, one does not obtain any points. Scoring: Water level too high: -1 game; Caught drop: +5 points; Bucket emptied into the cellar: -x and Bucket emptied out of the window: +3x (where x = amount of drops caught); with good play: +1 game (max. 3).\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternate cabinet of Poly Play, displayed as part of the Game On exhibition in the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, March 2005\\r\\nThe eight aforementioned games were made available to be playable with the emulator MAME in 2000. Additionally, the names of four other games were found in the source code: Der Gärtner (The Gardener), Im Gewächshaus (In the Greenhouse), Hagelnde Wolken (Hailing Clouds, a Space Invaders clone) and Der Taucher (The Diver, a game where malicious fish attack a diver). All four games have been installed on at least some machines, the same goes for the games Im Irrgarten (In the Maze), Der Lindwurm (The Lindworm), Fly and AFU. Another game titled UFO is actually the original version of Hagelnde Wolken, but was edited due to being deemed too martial by the authorities.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":[\"Action\",\"Racing\",\"Shooter\",\"Sports\"]},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"VEB Polytechnik\",\"Developer\":\"VEB Polytechnik\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/50110-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"1024\",\"height\":\"1820\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/50110-1.jpg\"}}}}","Ponpoko":{},"Pooyan":"{\"id\":\"12677\",\"GameTitle\":\"Pooyan\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"03/31/1982\",\"Overview\":\"Armed with a bow and arrows and slabs of meat, mama pig must defend/save her piglets from the wolves ballooning up or down the cliff.

The player can make Popeye walk back and forth and up and down stairs and ladders with a 4-way joystick. There is a punch button, but unlike similar games of the period, no jump button. Conversely, Brutus can jump down a level and also jump up to hit Popeye if he is directly above.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the feature of a punch button, Popeye cannot attack Brutus directly. Instead, the button is used for the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nPunching destroys items that could hurt Popeye such as bottles, vultures and skulls.\\r\\nEach level has a can of spinach; punching these cans will give Popeye invincibility and he can knock out Brutus just by running into him, although after a few seconds Brutus will swim back out and be ready for action again.\\r\\nIn Round 1 (the dock scene) of each three-round cycle is a punching bag, which Popeye can use to knock loose a nearby barrel from its position near the top of the playing field. If the barrel falls onto Brutus' head, the player earns bonus points (based on where Brutus was attacked) and renders Brutus harmless for several seconds.\\r\\nOther licensed Popeye characters in the game are Olive Oyl, Swee'Pea, and Wimpy, though they are mostly decorative and do not add heavily to the gameplay. Wimpy appears in Round 2 (the street scene) on one end of the seesaw in the lower left corner of the field, to act as a counterweight. Swee'Pea floats high above, with bonus points to be earned if Popeye can spring off the see-saw and touch him.\\r\\nPopeye loses a life if he is hit by Brutus or any thrown/flying object, or if he fails to catch a dropped item before it reaches the bottom of the screen.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Platform\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAjUXCqbs5I\",\"Publisher\":\"Nintendo\",\"Developer\":\"Nintendo\",\"Rating\":\"10\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"12\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"22173\",\"PlatformId\":\"22\"},{\"id\":\"5195\",\"PlatformId\":\"26\"},{\"id\":\"10413\",\"PlatformId\":\"31\"},{\"id\":\"49165\",\"PlatformId\":\"40\"},{\"id\":\"46936\",\"PlatformId\":\"4950\"},{\"id\":\"4081\",\"PlatformId\":\"32\"},{\"id\":\"22874\",\"PlatformId\":\"4927\"},{\"id\":\"50948\",\"PlatformId\":\"4929\"},{\"id\":\"1442\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\"},{\"id\":\"25255\",\"PlatformId\":\"4\"},{\"id\":\"29671\",\"PlatformId\":\"4913\"},{\"id\":\"37870\",\"PlatformId\":\"4953\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/31869-1.png\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"325\",\"height\":\"422\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/31869-1.png\"}},\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/31869-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"512\",\"height\":\"448\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/31869-1.jpg\"},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/31869.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"115\"}}}}","Port Man":"{\"id\":\"7848\",\"GameTitle\":\"Port Man\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"10/01/1982\",\"Overview\":\"Port Man was produced by Nova Games Ltd. in 1982.\\r\\n\\r\\nNova Games Ltd. released 4 different machines in our database under this trade name, starting in 1982.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther machines made by Nova Games Ltd. during the time period Port Man was produced include Intrepid, New Multi Game 5, and Street Viper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGame Play\\r\\n\\r\\nCatch the luggage that falls from the top conveyer belt and throw it up into one of four berths on the ship.

The player must navigate terrain and fight enemies using various weapons. The player's spacecraft has, by default, a weak but rapid-firing main gun; and a more powerful gun called a wave cannon, which requires the player to hold the fire button to build up power for the cannon.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the game, the player can obtain an auxiliary device called a Force. This resembles a glowing orange ball. The Force can be attached to the front or back of the player's spacecraft, or detached to fly freely.

The cursor is controlled with a trackball by the player, who has to roll it fast in one direction in order to overcome the momentum of gravitation imposed by the sun. Swarms of enemy objects named after various radioactive particles float around in the reactor arena, obeying simple physical laws. These enemies can freely bounce into the walls at low speeds, have a repulsive force against each other and actively attack the player cursor. Boss types often break up into several smaller particles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe object is to survive the sun and walls while gaining the highest score possible. It takes a delicate touch. Rather than moving the cursor/avatar left, right, up and down as in many arcade games, it is controlled by gravity and moves freely; with the player only being able to accelerate it rather than control its movements directly. Meanwhile the enemy particles are getting so aggressive that it can get very difficult to avoid being pulled in by the sun or touching a wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic gameplay consists of accelerating the cursor just at the right times so that it circles the reactor core with enough speed to have control via its own momentum when the enemy particles try to knock it off course, and then to place decoys and actually use the acceleration of the ball itself to knock enemies into control rods, traps or the reactor core.

The game featured one or two robot bowlers playing with the standard bowling rules. To control the outcome, the game had five buttons: left, right, shoot, hook left, and hook right. \\\"Hooking\\\" the ball was the key to getting a good score, as you could only hook the ball after it had been thrown. This made it easy to pick up a spare, but the game made up for it by making splits very common.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobot Bowl was available in two different dedicated cabinets, an upright and a cocktail, both of them used the same internal hardware.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Robot Bowl upright was of the common 1970s 'short cabinet' design, as the machine had no marquee and was only as tall as the monitor. Some machines also had a decorative 'ball return' on the front at the very bottom of the cabinet. There is an interesting story behind that. At the time the game was created, Exidy had just purchased Fun Games and had a number of cabinets left over from one of Fun's driving games. They used these cabinets to get Robot Bowl into production quickly. The only problem was that the cabinets had a hole in the front where the gas pedal had been. Michael Cooper-Hart suggested that they silk-screen the words 'Ball Return' over the hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Robot Bowl cocktail was a square box with a perfectly round top. The player controls were on either side of the monitor (and you actually had to look at the game sideways to play).

Sinibombs are needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships. Though time is crucial, attempting to mine too quickly will destroy a planetoid without releasing any crystals. Enemy worker ships are also gathering crystals (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the Sinistar. Enemy warrior ships can directly attack the player's ship. The player is given a head-start before the enemy ships have enough crystals to begin construction. Game ends when the player's ships are all destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the Sinistar is completely formed, a digitized voice makes various threatening pronouncements, including \\\"Beware, I live!,\\\" \\\"I hunger, coward!,\\\" \\\"I am Sinistar!,\\\" \\\"Run! Run! Run!,\\\" \\\"Beware, coward!\\\", \\\"I hunger!,\\\" \\\"Run, coward!,\\\" and a loud roaring sound. The Sinistar has no weapon attacks, but if it contacts the player's ship while it darts about the playfield, the player's ship will be \\\"eaten\\\" and destroyed. A total of 13 Sinibombs are required to destroy a fully built Sinistar, although an incomplete Sinistar can be damaged to slow construction. Each short-range Sinibomb automatically targets the Sinistar when fired, but can be intercepted by a collision with an enemy ship, enemy fire, or a planetoid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe player moves from one zone to the next each time he defeats the Sinistar. A sequence of four zones repeats continuously after the first zone. Each is named for the most numerous feature of that zone: Worker Zone, Warrior Zone, Planetoid Zone, and Void Zone (the Void Zone is especially difficult because it has very few planetoids). Beginning with the first Worker Zone, a completed but damaged Sinistar can be repaired/rebuilt by the enemy ships by gathering more crystals, extending its \\\"lifespan\\\" if the player is unable to kill it quickly.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Shooter\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Williams Electronics\",\"Developer\":\"Williams Electronics\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"2\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"38426\",\"PlatformId\":\"22\"},{\"id\":\"5212\",\"PlatformId\":\"26\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/35478-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"600\",\"height\":\"796\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/35478-1.jpg\"}},\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/35478-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"240\",\"height\":\"292\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/35478-1.jpg\"}}}","Skull & Crossbones ":"{\"id\":\"45566\",\"GameTitle\":\"Skull & Crossbones\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"05/03/1989\",\"Overview\":\"Two pirates battle against a variety of enemies while picking up treasures in a quest to find and kill The Evil Wizard.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Fighting\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Developer\":\"Atari\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"2\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"43238\",\"PlatformId\":\"4911\"},{\"id\":\"2079\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/45566-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"850\",\"height\":\"1101\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/45566-1.jpg\"}},\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/45566-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"336\",\"height\":\"240\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/45566-1.jpg\"}}}","Sky Adventure ":"{\"id\":\"45567\",\"GameTitle\":\"Sky Adventure\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"05/03/1989\",\"Overview\":\"Choose between four plans to repel the attack of Colonel Claud.

Even more importantly from a historical perspective, Star Fire was the first game to keep a high score list where the player could enter his or her initials.

It is the second entry in the Street Fighter series and the arcade sequel to the original Street Fighter released in 1987. It is Capcom's fourteenth title that runs on the CP System arcade hardware. Street Fighter II improves upon the many concepts introduced in the first game, including the use of command-based special moves and a six-button configuration, while offering players a selection of multiple playable characters, each with their own unique fighting style, and introducing a combo system and competitive multiplayer combat between two players.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe success of Street Fighter II is credited with starting the fighting-game boom during the 1990s which inspired other game developers to produce their own fighting-game franchises, popularizing the genre, and setting off a renaissance for the arcade game industry in the early 1990s. The game is widely considered among critics to be one of the greatest fighting games as well as one of the greatest video games ever made. It was then ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System platform, for which it became a long-lasting system-seller. Its success led to a subseries of updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as several home versions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1994, the game had been played by at least 25 million people in the United States, at home and in arcades. The video game console ports sold more than 14 million copies worldwide; the Super NES port of the original game sold 6.3 million units, making it Capcom's best-selling single consumer game software until 2013 (when it was surpassed by Resident Evil 5) and remaining their best-selling game software on a single platform through to the present day.

It is interesting to note that, besides some airplanes taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. The player's main weapon is an unlimited supply of missiles which travel a max distance of half the screen's height. The player also has two bombs which destroy all objects within a large circular radius. These bombs can be blown off by enemy bullets. The player is killed after only one hit, and is re-spawned to a point approximately one whole vertical screen-length later, thus progressing the player past the obstacle that had killed him, albeit at a high cost. The player is given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 20000 points and every 80000 points thereafter. Flashing crosses scattered throughout each level award players power-ups depending on which color the cross is. A red cross will gives the player one side-firing mini-heli which shoots perpendicular to the player's helicopter. A white cross yields a forward firing mini-heli. It is possible to have a mix and match of side-helis, totaling no more than two. The green cross will award the player with an additional bomb, if the player currently has less than two. Grabbing power-ups when not necessary yields 5000 points.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a total of four stages, all of which start and end with a helipad.

Jumping is required to avoid other cars on the road; the player can either jump all the way over them, or land on them for points.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo complete a round, the player must collect 10 colored flags by running over them with the buggy. If the player passes by a flag without picking it up, it will appear again later in the round. The roads feature inclines and descents that affect the buggy's speed, and bridges that must be jumped.

Bombs – a straight firing, explosive weapon that retains the same firing pattern for all jets, but increases in launch count (number of times it can be fired at once) when upgraded. Defender – an explosive cluster-shot weapon that encircles the player's jet and remains the same when upgraded, but increases in count much like the Bombs. Missiles – homing missiles that fire from multiple directions of the jet. Similar to the Vulcan, the Missiles fire in different directions depending on the jet that is used.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery jet is equipped with a roll device that allows them to kamikaze safely into other jets. The roll must be re-charged after every use. Players also have the choice to pick up the S-Unit, a weapon attachment that empowers the jet's firing no matter what weapon is picked-up previously and every jet's S-Unit attack differs from the others. Once the S-Unit is equipped, the player cannot use their previous weapons unless the S-Unit is detonated. Detonating the S-Unit does not harm the player, but it does harm the enemy as the unit will detonate in a large and powerful explosion.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Shooter\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"Yes\",\"Publisher\":\"Data East\",\"Developer\":\"Data East\",\"Rating\":\"7\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"2\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"4708\",\"PlatformId\":\"18\"},{\"id\":\"35492\",\"PlatformId\":\"36\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/38695-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"850\",\"height\":\"1101\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/38695-1.jpg\"}}}}","Varth - Operation Thunderstorm ":"{\"id\":\"8278\",\"GameTitle\":\"Varth: Operation Thunderstorm\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"07/01/1992\",\"Overview\":\"Varth follows the story of a disaster that befalls a human colony on a planet of the same name.

Winky is equipped with a bow and arrow and explores a dungeon with rooms and hallways. The hallways are patrolled by large, tentacled monsters named Hallmonsters, which cannot be killed, injured, or stopped in any way. Once in a room, Winky may kill monsters, avoid traps and gather treasures. If they stay in any room too long, a Hallmonster will enter the room, chase and kill them. In this way, the Hallmonsters serve the same role as \\\"Evil Otto\\\" in the arcade game Berzerk. The more quickly the player finishes each level, the higher their score.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal of each room is only to steal the room's treasure. In most rooms, it is possible (though difficult) to steal the treasure without defeating the monsters within. Some rooms have traps that are only sprung when the player picks up the treasure. For instance, in \\\"The Two-Headed Room\\\", two 2-headed ettins appear the moment the player picks up the prize.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinky dies if he touches a monster or Hallmonster. Dead monsters decay over time and their corpses may block room exits, delaying Winky and possibly allowing the Hallmonster to enter. Shooting a corpse causes it to regress back to its initial death phase. The monsters themselves move in specific patterns but may deviate to chase the player, and the game's AI allows them to dodge the player's shots with varying degrees of \\\"intelligence\\\" (for example, the snakes of \\\"The Serpent Room\\\" are relatively slow to dodge arrows, the trolls of \\\"The Troll Room\\\" are quite adept at evasion).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game consists of three different dungeon levels with different rooms. After clearing all the rooms in a level the player advances to the next. After three levels the room pattern and monsters repeat, but at a higher speed and with a different set of treasures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe different dungeons in each level are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Level 1 - The Wall Room, The Serpent Room, The Skeleton Room, The Goblin Room\\r\\n    Level 2 - The Two-Headed Room, The Dragon Room, The Spider Room, The Troll Room\\r\\n    Level 3 - The Genie Room, The Demon Room, The Cyclops Room, The Bat Room\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest score on the original game was set in 1982 by 15-year-old Randy Kuntz of Fairview, Alberta\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Adventure\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osTKrmM8JKo\",\"Publisher\":\"Exidy\",\"Developer\":\"Exidy\",\"Rating\":\"5\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"3\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"1358\",\"PlatformId\":\"22\"},{\"id\":\"18665\",\"PlatformId\":\"31\"},{\"id\":\"10279\",\"PlatformId\":\"32\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/38694-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"850\",\"height\":\"1113\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/38694-1.jpg\"}},\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/38694-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"480\",\"height\":\"360\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/38694-1.jpg\"}}}","Victory":"{\"id\":\"25586\",\"GameTitle\":\"Victory\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"10/01/1982\",\"Overview\":\"Victory is a game which you control your Battlestar to destroy an alien force which has overrun your planet.

The easiest difficulty level starts the player(s) in the first level with no bonuses. The player controls a tank with constantly draining fuel, and must navigate through multiple levels (14 stations in the arcade version) from bottom to top, encountering obstacles and enemies. Along the way, a player may find powerups including tank fuel, stars (currency), shields, and two types of sub-weapons: smart shots (homing missiles) and bombs (powerful rockets). Each level has a key that will open a door at the top of the level, which will either take the player to the next level or to a special hub with multiple powerups that must be escaped in 10 seconds or less.  If the player is unable to escape, the tank will lose half its fuel. After escaping the hub, the player(s) then proceeds to the next station.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally, the player(s) will face a boss that must be defeated to advance. Normal shots are ineffective however, and the player must decide/guess the appropriate time to buy sub-weapons to greatly raise the chance of victory. After destroying a boss, the player(s) can continue to the end of the level.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween levels, the player is taken to a shop where items and upgrades to tank speed, power, etc. may be purchased with stars. Any damage caused to the player's tank will decrease the shield level. Purchasing a shield drastically reduces damage down to a mere pixel worth of the fuel gauge per hit. When the fuel depletes, the speed of the tank is reduced to a crawl and a countdown begins from 10. If no fuel is gained before the timer reaches zero, or if the player is shot during the countdown, the tank explodes and a life is lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arcade version, in addition to having special two-joystick controls for each player, contained three special contest levels, with one contest star in each. With three contest stars and nine normal stars, the player(s) could compete in a special time-limited contest level in which the player could win a T-shirt.

When the game is first started, players are treated to a parody of the MGM logo featuring Momo instead of a lion and a \\\"Modoki\\\" instead of a mask. The game then cuts to a scene of a theater stage, where a play begins starring Momo, a young woman who gets super-powers. At this point the game puts the player in command of Momo. Rather than playing a hero who needs to save the world, the setting is that of a live stage show (set at the \\\"Namco Theater\\\"), and the player is actually controlling an actress who is merely playing the role of Momo/Wonder Momo. The game also features voice samples in Japanese.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Momo, she can only attack using kicks, and in doing so builds up her \\\"Wonder\\\" meter. When she touches a tornado icon, or spins around by herself, she can turn into Wonder Momo and can also attack using the Wonder Hoop, which can be reused as long as she is Wonder Momo. After the Wonder Hoop is thrown, she won't be able to throw anymore, while she'll have to wait for it to bounce back to her. She can also shoot small waves of energy in whichever direction she faces (while she is crouching), which is based on the similar move by the Ultraman characters. Her most powerful attack is the Wonder Typhoon - a more powerful version of her small energy wave attack which shoots numerous amounts of small energy waves towards the left and right sides of the screen simultaneously, while she is spinning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game is notable for featuring some slightly risqué content for the time, in the form of fanservice (at Momo's expense). When Momo jumps, the player can visibly see her underwear. Momo also needs to be wary of photographers in the theatre audience, who are determined to get a peek under her miniskirt. If one is successful, Momo will get \\\"embarrassed\\\" (stunned) for a short period of time. Additionally, one of the images that appears on the theater curtain (at the beginning and end of some acts) is Momo wearing only a towel.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":[\"Action\",\"Platform\"]},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Namco\",\"Developer\":\"Namco\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"1\",\"Game\":{\"id\":\"38162\",\"PlatformId\":\"34\"}},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/39670-1.png\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"211\",\"height\":\"300\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/39670-1.png\"}}}}","World Court ":"{\"id\":\"24252\",\"GameTitle\":\"World Court\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\",\"Platform\":\"Arcade\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/01/1988\",\"Overview\":\"Pro Tennis: World Court is a tennis sports arcade game that was released by Namco in 1988 only in Japan; it runs upon Namco System 1 hardware, and was inspired by the 1987 Famicom game Family Tennis.

Players can find energy pods to restore energy levels, keys to open doors, and golden coins.
