After defeating them, the player can select any of the nearby doors to enter: Some lead to different areas, but others will simply reveal a bell for the player to collect. Before the player can take this bell, the game presents a sum and the player must slash at numbers on the walls to complete the correct answer, then hit an \\\"OK\\\" symbol to submit it: If the answer's correct, they collect the bell and move on. If the answer is incorrect, the door that contains the bell closes and more monsters flood the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe player can visit a store and a hint section at any time by hitting the Select button.

The eight teams are Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal, Los Angeles, Minnesota, Chicago, and New York. Each team has one anonymous line of 3 forwards, 2 defensemen and 1 goalie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two game types: Exhibition and Tournament. In Exhibition, the player takes on either a CPU or another human-controlled team for a single match. In Tournament, the player’s team is placed into a three-round elimination tournament. Both game types can be played on three difficulty levels; Junior, College and Pro.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the matches are structured the same as regular hockey games (3 periods of 20 minutes each), the speed of the clock is sped up. There are no offside or penalty calls, with one notable exception. If two players bump into each other a few times, they will start a fight. Interestingly, only the loser is sent to the penalty box. The only other enforced infraction is “Icing”. If the game is tied after the 3 periods, it moves to a shootout. The team with the most goals after 5 shots wins, and if the score is still tied, the shootout continues until there is a winner.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Sports\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Konami\",\"Developer\":\"Konami\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/45348-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"190\",\"height\":\"209\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/45348-1.jpg\"}}}}","Konamic Tennis":"{\"id\":\"42891\",\"GameTitle\":\"Konami Tennis\",\"PlatformId\":\"4936\",\"Platform\":\"Famicom Disk System\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"08/19/1988\",\"Overview\":\"Real tennis rallying, with fierce serves, powerful smashes and fast volleys!

The goal is to use the shape-shifting protagonist (who transforms from an angel to a devil form) to switch all the panels on the screen to the same color, keeping in mind that every panel in a horizontal and vertical line will flip over.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeographic Nazoler Quiz\\r\\nLike the transportation quiz from the first Nazoler Land, this is a quiz game with a geographical theme. Rather than crossing over Japan in various types of transport, the goal is to travel the world and answer questions on different countries. Answering enough questions correctly allows the player to buy a ticket to the next location and progress forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nStraw Pistil\\r\\nA gambling game in which the player barters against AI opponents for money.

The player must also not any let mice touch Tomo on the way down.\\r\\n\\r\\nNazoler Boys' Detective Club\\r\\nA parody of Famicom Tantei Club, the player is the leader of a detective club currently investigating a mansion supposedly hiding incriminating evidence.

Like its predecessors, it was developed and published by Sunsoft for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System in Japan only, and contains various minigames with diverse gameplay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese minigames include:\\r\\n\\r\\nSugoro Quiz\\r\\nAll three Nazoler games had a quiz minigame of some kind, but Sugoro Quiz is the first to emphasize a multiplayer aspect. Two to four human players compete in a board game in which players progress by answering trivia questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nTomo Bakuso\\r\\nThe second minigame starring the schoolgirl Tomo, after Nazoler Land Dai 2 Gou's Blast Tomo.

It is the first in a series of four Nazoler games.\\r\\n\\r\\nNazoler Land Soukan Gou is the first in a series of minigame collections from SunSoft developed especially for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System peripheral. It was followed by two direct sequels and a quiz-based spin-off.\\r\\n\\r\\nNazoler Land Soukan Gou (or Nazoler Land Vol. 1) has eight minigames that the player can select from a menu after loading the game up and switching the disk around. These are:\\r\\n\\r\\nRotation Maze\\r\\nA maze-like puzzle game where a small circular being has to pass through a maze filled with dividers. The player can only pass through these dividers if there is room for it to turn around, otherwise it blocks the player's progress. The goal is to find the correct path through the maze.\\r\\n\\r\\nNazoler Fortune-Telling\\r\\nDespite using signs of the Zodiac and suggesting a fortune-telling aspect, the game is actually a variant on the classic strategy board game Mastermind: The goal is to find the right combination of Zodiac symbols, and the game will provide hints by reporting whenever the player includes the right symbol, either in the correct place (represented by a solid star) or the wrong place (represented as a hollowed star).\\r\\n\\r\\nSuper Jigsaw\\r\\nIn this game the player simply has to reconstruct an image after pieces of it have been jumbled up. All the player must do is use two cursors to point to the two pieces they wish to switch around. Restoring the image to its initial state completes the challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nSave Princess Momoko!\\r\\nPromoted as the \\\"major feature\\\", or the most fully-developed of the minigames. The goal is to explore a dungeon in a first-person perspective, similar to classic dungeon crawlers such as Wizardry, Dungeon Master or Shining in the Darkness, while finding items and using the correct items on the right monsters to proceed past them. Encountering these monsters before finding the right item to defeat them causes the player to lose, so there's a degree of trial and error.\\r\\n\\r\\nJapan's Best Surroundings: Ultra Travel Quiz\\r\\nA quiz based on traveling around Japan and general geographical facts. The player selects which type of transportation (train, plane, etc.) they wish to take and answers questions relating to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFamicom Reaction Test\\r\\nIn this simple \\\"game\\\", two players compete to hit the button on their controller as many times as they can in the short time limit. This test is presented like a Wild West duel.\\r\\n\\r\\nExtrusion Puzzle\\r\\nSimilar to Super Jigsaw, only the player is sliding blocks around to make a puzzle appear. Pushing one block that's against another causes all touching blocks to move at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n3D Maze\\r\\nA simple 3D maze, presented in the same first-person perspective as the Saving Princess Momoko game, though with a stark blue and white appearance.

One day, an evil army attacked this peaceful little kingdom and stole the Triforce of Power. This army was led by Ganon, the powerful Prince of Darkness who sought to plunge the World into fear and darkness under his rule. Fearing his wicked rule, Zelda, the princess of this kingdom, split up the Triforce of Wisdom into eight fragments and hid them throughout the realm to save the last remaining Triforce from the clutches of the evil Ganon. At the same time, she commanded her most trustworthy nursemaid, Impa, to secretly escape into the land and go find a man with enough courage to destroy the evil Ganon. Upon hearing this, Ganon grew angry, imprisoned the princess, and sent out a party in search of Impa.\\r\\n\\r\\nBraving forests and mountains, Impa fled for her life from her pursuers. As she reached the very limit of her energy she found herself surrounded by Ganon's evil henchmen. Cornered! What could she do? ... But wait! All was not lost. A young lad appeared. He skillfully drove off Ganon's henchmen, and saved Impa from a fate worse than death.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis name was Link. During his travels he had come across Impa and Ganon's henchmen. Impa told Link the whole story of the princess Zelda and the evil Ganon. Burning with a sense of justice, Link resolved to save Zelda, but Ganon was a powerful opponent. He held the Triforce of Power. And so, in order to fight off Ganon, Link had to bring the scattered eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom together to rebuild the mystical triangle. If he couldn't do this, there would be no chance Link could fight his way into Death Mountain where Ganon lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan Link really destroy Ganon and save Princess Zelda?\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly your skill can answer that question. Good luck. Use the Triforce wisely.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Adventure\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Nintendo\",\"Developer\":\"Nintendo\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/19053-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"860\",\"height\":\"970\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/19053-1.jpg\"}}}}"}
