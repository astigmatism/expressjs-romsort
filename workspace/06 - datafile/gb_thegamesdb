While there is a released Pinocchio game for the Game Boy mono, “Adventures of…” is a completely different title and Bit Managers never listed this one on their homepage, only Ottifanten. A playable version of this beta was leaked online, and it’s often confused for an official released game. Trying out the game shows that you cannot lose any lives – the counter won’t work. This is no final release and there is none because it’s an unreleased game.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we can read in a Wikipedia entry, the game relies on 115 separate levels of puzzle action, played by viewing the playing field in isometric projection. Pinocchio’s main objective is to get to the arrow (the exit) on the screen in order to move onto the next level. If the player is able to navigate Pinocchio to the objective before the timer runs out, he gets a certain number of points equal to the time left. Once this number reaches 500, the Fairy will bestow Pinocchio with an extra life.\\r\\n\\r\\nA closer look at the dump floating around will reveal a weird internal name “Infrey Quest”, so we can speculate that before Pinocchio and Ottifanten, Bit Managers tried to develop their own original IP. When they did not find any publisher interested in Infrey Quest, they changed the game in Pinocchio and later into Ottifanten, with their more recognized characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nOttifanten uses the same game concept as well and the same music as Adventure of Pinocchio.

It was one of the first Sailor Moon-related video games to be released.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this game, the player controlled Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon. The storyline was based on the first, third, and fourth episodes of the first season of the anime. Although they originally had not yet appeared in those episodes, in the game Usagi could meet and talk to Ami and Rei, who were NPCs (non-player characters).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three levels were divided into two parts. First, Usagi could walk through the city, school or a health spa, occassionally talking to people. After talking to the right people, Usagi turned into Sailor Moon and entered another kind of level in which she fought numerous enemies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy default, Sailor Moon could only use kicking attacks.

But it won't be easy, since many enemies just don't stay still for you to walk up and plant a bomb next to them. It's all in the strategy of bomb-placement. Plus, once a level's complete, you'll have to pick the proper exit that appears.

Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger head-butt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher's, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonk—in a best-of-three battle to \\\"bonk\\\" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power.

If the puzzle could be solved within the allotted period of time, the player would be awarded a bonus life. For every two pieces placed correctly, the player would be awarded with one extra hit point. If any of the missing pieces were missed or if the puzzle isn't solved in time, then the game will automatically piece the whole image together (without any bonuses, of course).

The main character, an ex-race car driver, takes on the role of an undercover cop. It seems your superior officer has decided to put your talents to the test. He orders you to infiltrate the local mob group, and to help bring it down from the inside. As a result, the game takes place from the perspective of a low-level gang member. The action speeds into a number of different cities, ranging from San Francisco to Miami. It is on the streets that the main part of the game will take place. \\r\\n\\r\\nBasically, Driver is broken into a number of mini-missions. In total, over 30 different challenges await the persistent gamer. The missions are divided between the various locales of the game. The different assignments will each require a special tactic. As an example, consider the mission in which the objective is to destroy an enemy getaway vehicle. In such a situation, the primary goal is to keep an eye on the target and ram it into submission. If the orders are to pick up a gang member within a time limit, speed and secrecy become of utmost importance. If the cops see the exchange, the badges will be on you like glue. Each situation will require a measure of thought and intelligence. \\r\\n\\r\\nDriver also offers a couple of extra side games. The survival mode sets the player against a horde of maniacal police officers. The crazed cops will do anything to smash you into submission. The result is a race through the city with a bunch of cops on your tail. It is a test of endurance. In the getaway mode, the idea is to flee for safety from the encroaching stiffs. The game places you in an area of the city, with a cop on your tail. Your only goal is to avoid the authorities. Be careful, though, as the cops may set up a roadblock to impede your progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nDriver is designed with the Game Boy Color in mind.

The playing field wraps around at the edges, so a globe or the ship travelling off the left edge (for example) will re-appear on the right. Globes come in three different colors, and those of the same color will disappear when they collide, whereas differing-colored globes will produce small pods, of the third color. Pods can be collected for more energy, but if they are not picked up quickly, they will turn into globes. There are 50 levels of increasing difficulty. On some levels, elastic bands connect certain globes, or even attach the player's ship to one or more globes. Destroying a globe will remove any elastic band attached to it.

Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly. Kirby can also inhale objects and enemies, swallowing them or spitting them out as projectiles.\",\"ESRB\":\"E - Everyone\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Platform\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJjcHAU5jb8\",\"Publisher\":\"Nintendo\",\"Developer\":\"HAL Laboratory\",\"Rating\":\"8.5\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/8706-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"643\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/8706-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/8706-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"640\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/8706-1.jpg\"}}],\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/8706-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"480\",\"height\":\"360\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/8706-1.jpg\"}}}","Kirby's Dream Land 2":"{\"id\":\"3190\",\"GameTitle\":\"Kirby's Dream Land 2\",\"PlatformId\":\"4\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"05/01/1995\",\"Overview\":\"The Rainbow Bridges have disappeared!

The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Time Warner Interactive, Inc.\",\"Developer\":\"The Sales Curve Ltd.\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"4\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"5047\",\"PlatformId\":\"21\"},{\"id\":\"4671\",\"PlatformId\":\"18\"},{\"id\":\"28028\",\"PlatformId\":\"36\"},{\"id\":\"3210\",\"PlatformId\":\"6\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/24086-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"632\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/24086-1.jpg\"}}}}","Lazlos' Leap":"{\"id\":\"21662\",\"GameTitle\":\"Lazlos' Leap\",\"PlatformId\":\"4\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"10/01/1992\",\"Overview\":\"Lazlos' Leap is a Puzzle game, developed and published by Hect, which was released in 1992.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Puzzle\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"DTMC\",\"Developer\":\"Hect\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/21662-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"639\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/21662-1.jpg\"}}}}","Legend":{},"Legend of Heroes":{},"Legend of Zelda, The - Link's Awakening":"{\"id\":\"3193\",\"GameTitle\":\"The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening\",\"PlatformId\":\"4\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"06/06/1993\",\"Overview\":\"A Game Boy fantasy adventure like no other!\\r\\n\\r\\nNintendo's fantasy adventure hero, Link of Hyrule, returns in this new epic quest...Link's Awakening.

Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross.

The player can choose whether they want to focus on the management side of football, play the matches themselves on the game's 2D match engine, or combine the two features for a more in-depth experience. It is endorsed by Irish football manager David O'Leary, who was managing Leeds United A.F.C. at the time of the game's release.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe management side of O'Leary Manager 2000 is very comprehensive when compared to similar Game Boy Color games. The player can choose from 240 fully licensed teams from the top two leagues in England, France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands to play as or manage, with each team having 16 players in their squad. There is also the option to promote a number of fictional youth team players. However, most of the youth team players are of low ability, so could only realistically be used for back-up when managing a decent quality team.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with any football management game, the transfer market can often play a key role in whether the team achieves success. The player's selected team starts with either 10.5m or 5.5m to spend, depending on whether they were in the first or second tier of their country's football hierarchy. The player can also recoup some money by selling players to other teams. This is done by first offering the footballer for sale at a chosen price, from which interested clubs would then place offers that the player could choose to accept or not. Once a price is agreed, the footballer transfers clubs instantly. The values of footballers alternate greatly during the game, with the then Real Betis striker Denílson being the most expensive player at the start of the game. An unfortunate bug in the game allows the player to gain a huge sum of money (around 70m) if the club goes into a certain amount of debt, which pretty much negates the need for financial planning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club's board of directors constantly give assessments as to how they think the club is progressing under your management. This involves a short statement visible at the menu screen. Other features available the menu screen include options to change you team line-up, formation and tactics; all vital when creating a successful team.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, you can decide what methods of training your team will undertake for the coming week. You have the option to \\\"do training\\\", which generally increase the statistics of your players (but at the risk of injuring them) or to concentrate on fitness training (which helps players stay fit and injured players to recover quicker). Alternatively, you may choose to skip training entirely for the week. You also have the option to view various statistics, such as league tables from around the world, top goalscorers and to view the squads of all available teams on the game.\",\"ESRB\":\"E - Everyone\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Sports\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Ubisoft\",\"Developer\":\"LiveMedia\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/44455-1.png\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"500\",\"height\":\"500\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/44455-1.png\"}}}}","Obelix":{},"Oddworld Adventures":"{\"id\":\"21511\",\"GameTitle\":\"Oddworld Adventures\",\"PlatformId\":\"4\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"12/01/1998\",\"Overview\":\"You're Abe, the chanting Mudokon - the skinny guy in the loincloth with no weapons.

The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from. The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.\\r\\n\\r\\nGames are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.

Gems \\\"fall in\\\" from the top of the play area one line at a time and are connected to each other either horizontally or vertically. Hitting a gem with the ball will destroy it, and if the destroyed gem causes other gems to no longer be connected to the top of the play area, they fall off, scoring bonus points. Destroying a special flashing gem also destroys all regular gems of the same color in the playfield. There are also metallic blocks that take more than one hit to destroy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe player controls a paddle at the bottom of the playfield, which can move left and right to bounce the ball back upward. Unlike in most other Breakout-style games, missing the ball does not cost a life or end the game, but rather adds more lines of gems to the top of the playfield. Gem lines will advance on their own after a certain amount of time, as well as when the playfield is cleared entirely or drops below a certain number of gems. If the gems advance across the line at the bottom of the playfield where the paddle resides, the player loses and the game is over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arcade version of Puchi Carat features three main gameplay modes: A single-player mode where the goal is to clear a certain number of gem lines, a story mode in which the player challenges each character in a head-to-head battle (where dropped gems are added to the opponent's playfield from the bottom), and a two-player versus mode following the same rules as the story mode. Each of the single-player modes offers three levels of difficulty. Various ports of the game offer additional gameplay modes (such as time-attack mode), more difficulty levels, and expanded storylines for each character.\",\"ESRB\":\"E - Everyone\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Puzzle\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh_qDbO65XQ\",\"Publisher\":\"Taito\",\"Developer\":\"Evolution Entertainment\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"1\",\"Game\":{\"id\":\"29261\",\"PlatformId\":\"10\"}},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/33090-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"642\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/33090-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/33090-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"498\",\"height\":\"500\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/33090-1.jpg\"}}]}}","Pumuckl's Abenteuer bei den Piraten":"{\"id\":\"43053\",\"GameTitle\":\"Pumuckl´s Abenteuer bei den Piraten\",\"PlatformId\":\"41\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Color\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"05/12/1999\",\"Overview\":\"Pumuckls Abenteuer bei den Piraten is an action/adventure game developed by NEON Software and published by Acclaim Entertainment for the Game Boy Color platform.\\r\\n\\r\\nPumuckls Abenteuer bei den Piraten was only released in Germany and stars a popular cartoon character, Pumuckl.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":[\"Action\",\"Adventure\"]},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Acclaim Entertainment\",\"Developer\":\"NEON Software\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/43053-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"800\",\"height\":\"822\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/43053-1.jpg\"}}}}","Pumuckl's Abenteuer im Geisterschloss":"{\"id\":\"43055\",\"GameTitle\":\"Pumuckl´s Abenteuer im Geisterschloss\",\"PlatformId\":\"41\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Color\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"11/15/2000\",\"Overview\":\"Pumuckls Abenteuer im Geisterschloss is an action game developed by NEON Software and published by Acclaim Entertainment for the Game Boy Color platform.\\r\\n\\r\\nPumuckls Abenteuer im Geisterschloss was only released in Germany and is based off of a cartoon series titled Pumuckls Abenteuer. both the game and TV show star the main character Pumuckl.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":[\"Action\",\"Adventure\"]},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Acclaim Entertainment\",\"Developer\":\"NEON Software\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/43055-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"385\",\"height\":\"395\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/43055-1.jpg\"}}}}","Punisher, The - The Ultimate Payback":"{\"id\":\"21704\",\"GameTitle\":\"The Punisher: The Ultimate Payback\",\"PlatformId\":\"4\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"07/01/1991\",\"Overview\":\"The Punisher: The Ultimate Payback is an Action game, developed by Beam Software and published by Acclaim, which was released in 1991.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Acclaim\",\"Developer\":\"Beam Software\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/21704-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"350\",\"height\":\"349\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/21704-1.jpg\"}}}}","Purikura Pocket - Fukanzen Joshikousei Manual":{},"Purikura Pocket 2 - Kareshi Kaizou Daisakusen":{},"Purikura Pocket 3 - Talent Debut Daisakusen":{},"Puyo Puyo":"{\"id\":\"25256\",\"GameTitle\":\"Puyo Puyo\",\"AlternateTitles\":{\"title\":\"ぷよぷよ\"},\"PlatformId\":\"4\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"07/31/1994\",\"Overview\":\"This game was released only in Japan and is a port of the Arcade original.\",\"ESRB\":\"E - Everyone\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Puzzle\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Banpresto\",\"Developer\":\"Compile\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"8\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"45340\",\"PlatformId\":\"4936\"},{\"id\":\"38538\",\"PlatformId\":\"4932\"},{\"id\":\"33786\",\"PlatformId\":\"4929\"},{\"id\":\"30999\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\"},{\"id\":\"42963\",\"PlatformId\":\"4934\"},{\"id\":\"27409\",\"PlatformId\":\"20\"},{\"id\":\"34022\",\"PlatformId\":\"18\"},{\"id\":\"20718\",\"PlatformId\":\"36\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/25256-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"343\",\"height\":\"395\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/25256-1.jpg\"}},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/25256.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"175\"}}}}","Puyo Puyo Gaiden - Puyo Wars":{},"Puzzle Master":"{\"id\":\"22054\",\"GameTitle\":\"Puzzle Master\",\"PlatformId\":\"41\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Color\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"12/01/1999\",\"Overview\":\"The Goblin King has corrupted the elements and is flooding the world, and it's up to you to save it.

Three difficult levels help beginners to adjust to the artificial intelligence on \\\"skill level 1\\\" while novices get some extra challenge on \\\"skill level 2\\\" and experts get the ultimate challenge on \\\"skill level 3.\\\" A strict time limit forces players to finish races without mistakes in order to progress to a more complicated race track.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral Nintendo characters appear at the end of race circuits: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Bowser, Link, Samus, Pit and Donkey Kong.

Pro-Am is a racing video game that is similar to its predecessor, R.C. Pro-Am, for the NES. In the game, players race remote control cars on a series of tracks. It can be played solo, with two-players via the Game Link Cable, or with three or four players via the Four Player Adapter. The game features 24 different tracks of increasing difficulty, and the object is to finish in the top three in order to qualify to race in the next track. Players who do not finish in the top three may use a continue and retry the track; players get three continues, and the game ends when the player fails to finish in the top three and has no continues remaining.\\r\\nEach track is different and range from standard ovals to tracks with many twists and turns. The game includes many obstacles, such as oil slicks that send players spinning, puddles of water that cause players to slide out of control, sand traps and \\\"slow cones\\\" that slow players down, large cones that bring players to a complete halt, and walls of tires that players bounce off. If a player hits an oil slick and then hits a wall while spinning, the player's car is temporarily destroyed, which loses time. The tracks also has items that help players along the way: \\\"zippers\\\" (a series of chevrons on the track) give players a speed boost, roll cages allow players to hit walls without being destroyed and allow them to crash opponents by forcing them into walls, and missiles and bombs temporarily destroy opponents' cars. Also on the track are spare parts which help improve performance—tires improve traction, batteries increase acceleration, and engines improve speed.\\r\\nPlayers have the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles by collecting letters, which are distributed throughout the tracks. By spelling \\\"Nintendo\\\" with the letters, players upgrade to a better vehicle; players can upgrade from the \\\"Racer\\\" to the \\\"Speed demon\\\" and then to the Spiker, each of which performs progressively better than the previous vehicle.

The player must arrange blocks in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more matching shapes by swapping blocks horizontally two at a time. As matching lines are formed, the blocks are cleared from the screen and any blocks above them fall into the gaps. The game is over when the blocks touch the top of the playfield, or another game-ending condition is met (such as reaching a time limit or clearing blocks below a set line). Clearing more than three tiles in a single move scores a Combo, while Chains are scored when falling blocks from one clear cause another clear to occur.
