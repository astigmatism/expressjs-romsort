While there is a released Pinocchio game for the Game Boy mono, “Adventures of…” is a completely different title and Bit Managers never listed this one on their homepage, only Ottifanten. A playable version of this beta was leaked online, and it’s often confused for an official released game. Trying out the game shows that you cannot lose any lives – the counter won’t work. This is no final release and there is none because it’s an unreleased game.\r\n\r\nAs we can read in a Wikipedia entry, the game relies on 115 separate levels of puzzle action, played by viewing the playing field in isometric projection. Pinocchio’s main objective is to get to the arrow (the exit) on the screen in order to move onto the next level. If the player is able to navigate Pinocchio to the objective before the timer runs out, he gets a certain number of points equal to the time left. Once this number reaches 500, the Fairy will bestow Pinocchio with an extra life.\r\n\r\nA closer look at the dump floating around will reveal a weird internal name “Infrey Quest”, so we can speculate that before Pinocchio and Ottifanten, Bit Managers tried to develop their own original IP. When they did not find any publisher interested in Infrey Quest, they changed the game in Pinocchio and later into Ottifanten, with their more recognized characters.\r\n\r\nOttifanten uses the same game concept as well and the same music as Adventure of Pinocchio. It even looks like the basic stage design is the same.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimt00jE1Po","Publisher":"Infogrames","Developer":"Bit Managers","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/37392-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"631","height":"602","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/37392-1.jpg"}}}},"Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, The":{"id":"18275","GameTitle":"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends","PlatformId":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1992","Overview":"The Game Boy version only has three levels, although generally with multiple sections.

The last survivor sets out to destroy the queen and regain the honor of his clan.\r\n\r\nThe Predator must traverse several side-scrolling levels on his way to the queen, while destroying Aliens in all their forms - facehuggers hatched from eggs, chestburster aliens and fully grown warriors. Various weapons are available: the standard weapon are the wrist blades. Ammunition for the shoulder cannon, the cutting disks and bombs must be picked up. The bombs not only work as weapons but can also be used to destroy barriers. To avoid a fight altogether, the Predator can also use his invisibility system, which runs down the energy supply. To recharge it, energy powerups must be collected. Also hidden in the levels are keys that open up doors blocking the way into the next area. A small radar map helps in navigating the maze-like corridors and also displays approaching enemies.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Activision","Developer":"ASK Kondansha","Rating":"6","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/18280-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"508","height":"501","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/18280-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/18280.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"95"}}}},"Aliens - Thanatos Encounter":{},"All Star Tennis 2000":{"id":"21874","GameTitle":"All Star Tennis 2000","PlatformId":"41","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ReleaseDate":"06/25/1999","Overview":"This is a cartoon style tennis challenge that requires all your skill!

Becoming Master Bonk dresses Bonk in a cape and provides him with Vulcan-esque ears, and gives him the ability to move faster and jump higher. Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger head-butt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher's, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys.\r\n\r\nGrabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonk—in a best-of-three battle to \"bonk\" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual.\r\n\r\nThe game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power.

When pressing a button, the symbols are rotated clockwise around the frame. Of course the levels have to be solved within a time limit.\r\n\r\nIn the higher difficulty levels, the player also has to deal with so-called special effects which occasionally kick in during play, e.g. some symbols get hidden by \"?\" blocks, symbols rotate on their own or the controls are reversed. Three power-ups can be earned by completing bonus levels or finishing a level really fast: clock (stops time for 20 seconds), flash (skips the current level) and credit (gives a second try after time has run out). Clock and flash have to be activated manually; credits is applied automatically.

There is a time limit that forces players to move quickly around the levels. Each chapter of the game starts off with a cover from a book. Checkpoints are used to maintain progress in a level after losing a life. Each level has a daytime and night time equivalent. A boss appears at the end of each night time level in order to test the playing skills and to reinforce the concepts that were taught in the daytime version of the level.\r\n\r\nThe player controls a young lawyer named Jonathan Harker.

You maneuver the cook up and down ladders and left and right across floors in order to walk across various parts of giant hamburgers, such as large lettuce, big buns and massive meat patties. After you cross any section of any hamburger, it will drop one level and push any other burger part within that stack down a floor as well. The object of the game is to build all the hamburgers in each stage by dropping all the makings of each burger into completed stacks at the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nAs you go about your burger building business, Food Foes Mr. Pickle, Mr. Egg and Mr. Hot dog (also known as Frank N. Furter) will chase after you. You can destroy these culinary cutups by trapping them in falling burger parts or by tricking them into walking on a burger part you are in the process of dropping. To freeze the Food Foes, you can sprinkle a dash of pepper on them. You begin the game with a small pepper supply and can pick up additional pepper shakers that appear throughout the levels. You can also pick up bonus points (in the guise of cups and saucers) and extra lives.\r\n\r\nUnlike the original BurgerTime, which had less than 10 different non-scrolling screens, BurgerTime Deluxe has seven levels with four stages in each level for a grand total of 28 screens, most of which scroll to some degree.

You play as a hunter looking to catch a nice trophy in one of four different areas using three different weapons. Hunt deer with a shotgun, a rifle, or a bow, using slightly different tactics with each. If you want to be successful, you'll have to use real-world hunting strategies. Search for droppings or other signs of movement to find the best area to wait in. Once there, use one of an assortment of tools to help you catch your prey: mask your odor with a cover scent, use a tree stand to camouflage yourself, or lure the deer with a powerful musk, a deer call, or an antler rattle. It's up to you to decide how to catch the deer; some methods are more efficient than others, so you'll have to find the one that works best for you. Detailed graphics and digitized sound round out the experience for would-be hunters.","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Vatical Entertainment","Developer":"Morning Star Multimedia","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"26653","PlatformId":"11"}},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/21944-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"200","height":"197","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/21944-1.jpg"}}}},"Defender of the Crown (PD)":{},"Defender-Joust":{},"Deja Vu I & II":{},"Dejiko no Mahjong Party":{},"Demiforce Demo (PD)":{},"Demo - TEST (PD)":{},"Demotronic Final Demo (PD)":{},"Denki Blocks!":{},"Denki Blocks!

The main character, an ex-race car driver, takes on the role of an undercover cop. It seems your superior officer has decided to put your talents to the test. He orders you to infiltrate the local mob group, and to help bring it down from the inside. As a result, the game takes place from the perspective of a low-level gang member. The action speeds into a number of different cities, ranging from San Francisco to Miami. It is on the streets that the main part of the game will take place. \r\n\r\nBasically, Driver is broken into a number of mini-missions. In total, over 30 different challenges await the persistent gamer. The missions are divided between the various locales of the game. The different assignments will each require a special tactic. As an example, consider the mission in which the objective is to destroy an enemy getaway vehicle. In such a situation, the primary goal is to keep an eye on the target and ram it into submission. If the orders are to pick up a gang member within a time limit, speed and secrecy become of utmost importance. If the cops see the exchange, the badges will be on you like glue. Each situation will require a measure of thought and intelligence. \r\n\r\nDriver also offers a couple of extra side games. The survival mode sets the player against a horde of maniacal police officers. The crazed cops will do anything to smash you into submission. The result is a race through the city with a bunch of cops on your tail. It is a test of endurance. In the getaway mode, the idea is to flee for safety from the encroaching stiffs. The game places you in an area of the city, with a cop on your tail. Your only goal is to avoid the authorities. Be careful, though, as the cops may set up a roadblock to impede your progress.\r\n\r\nDriver is designed with the Game Boy Color in mind. It offers a password save system to keep your data under wraps.","ESRB":"RP - Rating Pending","Genres":{"genre":"Racing"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Infogrames, Inc.","Developer":"Crawfish Interactive","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/17644-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"470","height":"470","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/17644-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/17644.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"136"}}}},"Dropzone":{"id":"25449","GameTitle":"Dropzone","PlatformId":"41","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1999","Overview":"Dropzone is an Action game, developed by Awesome Developments and published by Acclaim, which was released in Europe in 1999.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Acclaim","Developer":"Awesome Developments","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"18448","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"1815","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"21635","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"21772","PlatformId":"20"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/25449-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"642","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/25449-1.jpg"}}}},"Drunken Pooper (PD)":{},"Druzyna pierscienia by J.R.R.

Run from counter to counter, trying to build sandwiches for the hungry customers, avoiding attacks from the flying beasties all the while. Interestingly, the kitchen is also outfitted with a bunch of platforms and ladders which means you'll have your share of climbing to tackle as well. Lose all of your lives and you're out of a job (resulting in more time at home with the ingratiating Bam-Bam). The graphics and humor are perfect representations of the original cartoon, and the game plays much like the coin-operated BURGERTIME.

Your main weapon is the ability to dig both to the left and right of your character. The holes you dig are only temporary and fill themselves in. A robot that falls into one of your holes will be destroyed if the hole fills in before it can escape. Your character can also suffer this same fate, ending his life. Destroyed robots are replaced with new ones that appear from the top of the screen. The robots can also carry gold which they drop if they fall into a hole. The robot's movements are dependent on yours, and a significant facet of the game play is figuring out how to use the robot's movements to your advantage in clearing a stage. Besides bricks and ladders, levels also consist of blocks (which can't be dug into), rope (to traverse platform chasms) and crumbling bricks (which you fall through). Once all gold has been retrieved a missing segment of ladder will appear allowing your character to escape to the next level.

Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly.

The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.\r\n\r\nWhile the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.\r\n\r\nThe twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Time Warner Interactive, Inc.","Developer":"The Sales Curve Ltd.","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"5047","PlatformId":"21"},{"id":"4671","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"28028","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"3210","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/24086-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"632","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/24086-1.jpg"}}}},"Lazlos' Leap":{"id":"21662","GameTitle":"Lazlos' Leap","PlatformId":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ReleaseDate":"10/01/1992","Overview":"Lazlos' Leap is a Puzzle game, developed and published by Hect, which was released in 1992.","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"DTMC","Developer":"Hect","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/21662-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"639","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/21662-1.jpg"}}}},"Leather Goddesses of Phobos, The (PD)":{},"Legend":{},"Legend of Heroes":{},"Legend of Zelda, The - Link's Awakening":{"id":"3193","GameTitle":"The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening","PlatformId":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ReleaseDate":"06/06/1993","Overview":"A Game Boy fantasy adventure like no other!\r\n\r\nNintendo's fantasy adventure hero, Link of Hyrule, returns in this new epic quest...Link's Awakening.

The objective is to match Yoshi egg shells to hatch them and prevent the four stacks, which pile up from the falling monsters, from growing too tall. The player character Mario swaps the stacks around such that the falling monsters will be eliminated by coming into contact with the blocks they match.\r\n\r\nMonsters, which consist of various Mario enemies, appear at the top of the screen and fall into each the columns, turning into blocks as they land and creating stacks that incrementally grow in height. The main objective is to prevent the four stacks from growing too high by eliminating blocks from the field; a game over occurs when any of the stacks crosses the black line drawn across the top of the play field.[2]\r\n\r\nTo eliminate a block from the top of a stack, it must come in contact with a falling monster that matches it. For example, if a Goomba falls directly onto a Goomba block, both will be removed. The player controls Mario, who resides below the playing field and has the ability to swap the positions of any two adjacent stacks at a time. Thus, the player is required to switch around the stacks to ensure that the monsters fall into the correct places. Points are awarded for each set of monsters that are eliminated.[2]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the four different types of monsters, two halves of a Yoshi eggshell will also fall. The bottom eggshell half behaves like a monster: it disappears when it comes into contact with another bottom half. However, if a falling top half comes into contact with a bottom half, the two will join and hatch a Yoshi, earning the player bonus points. Furthermore, if a stack of monsters grows atop a bottom half and a top half is then added, all monsters between the halves will be encased and eliminated. Larger Yoshi characters will hatch depending on the number of monsters encased, which also increases the number of bonus points awarded.[2] If a falling top half does not have any bottom half to join to in the stack it touches, it is automatically removed and no points are awarded.\r\n\r\nThe single-player mode has two variations: A-Type and B-Type. In A-Type, the game is played indefinitely until the player receives a game over. In B-Type, the player plays a series of levels in which the player is required to completely clear the playing field of all the blocks. The initial number of blocks inside the playing field grows as the player progresses. In multiplayer mode, a second player controls Luigi. The two players play simultaneously in separate playing fields using the traditional rules. A player wins the match by clearing all the blocks in the field or when the other receives a game over; the first player to win three matches wins overall.","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Nintendo","Developer":"Game freak","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/38049-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"633","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/38049-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/38049-1.jpg","$":{"width":"480","height":"360"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/38049-1.jpg"}}},"Mario Tennis":{"id":"8629","GameTitle":"Mario Tennis","PlatformId":"41","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ReleaseDate":"06/16/2001","Overview":"Take your game to the next level with mario Tennis!

As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point.\r\n\r\nOutside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld. By defeating the game's bosses, players earn Core Units, which allow Metal Walkers to evolve into new, stronger forms.","Genres":{"genre":["Role-Playing","Strategy"]},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Capcom","Developer":"Capcom","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/8802-1.png","$":{"side":"back","width":"1459","height":"1450","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/8802-1.png"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/8802-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"500","height":"499","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/8802-1.jpg"}}]}},"Metamode":{},"Metroid II - Return of Samus":{"id":"6771","GameTitle":"Metroid II: Return of Samus","PlatformId":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ReleaseDate":"11/01/1991","Overview":"A Sinister Planet Threatens the Galaxy!\r\n\r\nSpace Hunter Samus Aran returns to battle a planet crawling with evil creatures bent on universal domination in this bigger than ever sequel to the NES classic, Metroid.\r\n\r\nTake control!

This pinball game was great fun on the PC, and now it is in a form that can be taken anywhere. There are seven different tables that are actually representative of real boards made by pinball giant Gottlieb throughout the last century. Each board carries a different theme, whether it is space travel or a haunted house. The boards also contain a varying number of paddles and paddle locations to make each a different playing experience. The graphics in this version are not as shiny as its computer counterpart, but they do translate well to the small color screen. The sound effects and music remain largely the same, adding to the game's arcade feel. The cartridge also contains a short but detailed history of pinball and how it has evolved over the years. MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE gives players the classic game with enough boards and extras to keep even the experts busy for quite a while.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Classified Games","Developer":"Saffire","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/21853-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"501","height":"501","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/21853-1.png"}}}},"Microsoft Puzzle Collection":{},"Midori no Makibaoo":{},"Mig 21 (PD)":{},"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers":{"id":"21671","GameTitle":"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers","PlatformId":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ReleaseDate":"08/01/1994","Overview":"It's Morphin Time!

Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a \"wall\" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.\r\n\r\nThe game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PqHNzpKITA","Publisher":"Namco","Developer":"Namco","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"25149","PlatformId":"20"},{"id":"673","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"29145","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"5772","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/21688-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"298","height":"298","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/21688-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/21688.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"74"}}}},"Pac-Man":{"id":"21690","GameTitle":"Pac-Man","PlatformId":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ReleaseDate":"04/01/1991","Overview":"Gobble, gobble, gulp!

Once you activate \"catch mode,\" you must hit the pop bumpers 6 times. Each hit unlocks 1/6 of an image of the Pokémon currently up for capture. Once the image is complete, the Pokémon appears on the table, where it must be hit 4 times with the ball to capture it.\r\n\r\n\"Evolution Mode,\" when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you select a captured Pokémon (from the current game in progress only) and attempt to evolve it into another form. This is the only way to add the evolved form to your Pokédex. Once you select a Pokémon, you must hit targets on the playfield. There are up to 6 targets, but only 3 of them have items in them you need to evolve a Pokémon. The others create a time-wasting sequence before you can hit targets again. If you hit a target with an item, the item appears on the playfield and must be collected with the ball. Once you've collected 3 items, the hole in the center of the board opens up. Sinking the ball in the hole successfully evolves the Pokémon.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":["Puzzle","Shooter"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Nintendo","Developer":"Jupiter","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/8639-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1359","height":"1370","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/8639-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/8639-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1526","height":"1370","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/8639-1.jpg"}}]}},"Pokemon Puzzle Challenge":{"id":"19067","GameTitle":"Pokémon Puzzle Challenge","PlatformId":"41","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ReleaseDate":"12/04/2000","Overview":"In a rising pit of colored blocks, it's your task to continuously eliminate these tiles by switching two tiles' positions on the horizontal row.

It's up to you to continuously work the bin to wipe out tiles by making combination connections and chain reactions. That's the game in a nutshell, but there are several modes of play that'll keep your fingers busy.

Although they originally had not yet appeared in those episodes, in the game Usagi could meet and talk to Ami and Rei, who were NPCs (non-player characters).\r\n\r\nThe three levels were divided into two parts. First, Usagi could walk through the city, school or a health spa, occassionally talking to people. After talking to the right people, Usagi turned into Sailor Moon and entered another kind of level in which she fought numerous enemies.\r\n\r\nBy default, Sailor Moon could only use kicking attacks. Pressing the \"down\" button would make Sailor Moon sit down and cry, and if there were rocks on the wall nearby, her high-pitched crying would make the rocks explode and drop special items. These items gave different powers: one enabled her to use Moon Tiara Action for a limited number of times, one made her invincible for a short amount of time, etc.\r\nThe bosses were Morga, Kyurene, Jadeite, and Queen Beryl. Sailor Moon actually had to fight Jadeite each time after defeating the two Youma, and at the end of the last level, had to fight him again before facing Queen Beryl.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Adventure"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Nintendo","Developer":"Angel Studios","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"29744","PlatformId":"4955"}},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/18784-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"245","height":"286","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/18784-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/18784-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"678","height":"795","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/18784-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/18784-1.jpg","$":{"width":"315","height":"285"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/18784-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/18784-2.jpg","$":{"width":"316","height":"283"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/18784-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/18784-3.jpg","$":{"width":"318","height":"286"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/18784-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/18784-4.jpg","$":{"width":"321","height":"285"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/18784-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/18784-5.jpg","$":{"width":"325","height":"292"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/18784-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/18784-6.jpg","$":{"width":"324","height":"293"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/18784-6.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/18784-7.jpg","$":{"width":"372","height":"336"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/18784-7.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/18784-8.jpg","$":{"width":"373","height":"336"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/18784-8.jpg"}]}},"Sailor Super V Movie (PD)":{},"Saishuu Gensou":{},"Sakata Gorou Kudan no Renju Kyoushitsu":{},"Sakigake Memorial (PD)":{},"Sakura Taisen GB - Geki Hana Kumi Nyuutai!":{},"Sakura Tasien GB2 - Thunder Volt Sakusen":{},"Same Game":{},"Same Or Not (PD)":{},"Samurai Kid":{},"Samurai Shodown":{"id":"21719","GameTitle":"Samurai Shodown","PlatformId":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ReleaseDate":"11/01/1994","Overview":"Iza To!

In the Family Computer version of the game, the cars come in three colors: red, light orange, and dark blue.\r\n\r\nGameplay is similar to that of Namco's Pole Position. Finishing in first, second, or third results in a podium finish; players must win on each track to advance to the next. Vehicles in the game have a generic two-speed manual transmission governing their speed (with a \"LOW\" setting and a \"HI\" setting). There are ten tracks in the race; the game repeats itself after the conclusion of the tenth circuit. Three difficult levels help beginners to adjust to the artificial intelligence on \"skill level 1\" while novices get some extra challenge on \"skill level 2\" and experts get the ultimate challenge on \"skill level 3.\" A strict time limit forces players to finish races without mistakes in order to progress to a more complicated race track.\r\n\r\nSeveral Nintendo characters appear at the end of race circuits: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Bowser, Link, Samus, Pit and Donkey Kong. The game resulted in a Grand Prix series sequel, featuring Famicom Grand Prix: F-1 Race and Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally.[citation needed] Similar to the original, both games were never released outside of Japan.","Genres":{"genre":"Racing"},"Co-op":"No","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/18691-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"180","height":"180","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/18691-1.jpg"}}}},"Spiritual Warfare":{},"Spirou":{"id":"24123","GameTitle":"Spirou","PlatformId":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1996","Overview":"Spirou, a journalist, and his friend Fantasio visit New York for an international conference of scientific research.

You take control of Anakin and try and defeat your \"rival\" on each of the game's tracks. When you come in first on any track, you can take control of that track's \"rival\" alien and his pod racer -- and each alien's Pod Racer controls and drives differently. The controls are of the simple Accelerate, Brake, Left Turn, Right Turn nature -- but like the N64 version of the game, you can activate an Engine Boost when your speed reaches a certain peak. But it's only for temporary use, and will cause damage to your engines if you leave it on for longer than a few seconds.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Racing"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Nintendo","Developer":"LucasArts","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/21834-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"200","height":"198","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/21834-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/21834.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"126"}}}},"StarFisher (PD)":{},"Stara basn by Jozef Ignacy Kraszewski (PD)":{},"Starcross (PD)":{},"Starfight (PD)":{},"Stargate":{"id":"23342","GameTitle":"Stargate","PlatformId":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ReleaseDate":"12/01/1994","Overview":"Travel through the StarGate to a new intergalactic dimension of non-stop action, danger and adventure!

Pro-Am is a racing video game that is similar to its predecessor, R.C. Pro-Am, for the NES. In the game, players race remote control cars on a series of tracks. It can be played solo, with two-players via the Game Link Cable, or with three or four players via the Four Player Adapter. The game features 24 different tracks of increasing difficulty, and the object is to finish in the top three in order to qualify to race in the next track. Players who do not finish in the top three may use a continue and retry the track; players get three continues, and the game ends when the player fails to finish in the top three and has no continues remaining.\r\nEach track is different and range from standard ovals to tracks with many twists and turns. The game includes many obstacles, such as oil slicks that send players spinning, puddles of water that cause players to slide out of control, sand traps and \"slow cones\" that slow players down, large cones that bring players to a complete halt, and walls of tires that players bounce off. If a player hits an oil slick and then hits a wall while spinning, the player's car is temporarily destroyed, which loses time. The tracks also has items that help players along the way: \"zippers\" (a series of chevrons on the track) give players a speed boost, roll cages allow players to hit walls without being destroyed and allow them to crash opponents by forcing them into walls, and missiles and bombs temporarily destroy opponents' cars. Also on the track are spare parts which help improve performance—tires improve traction, batteries increase acceleration, and engines improve speed.\r\nPlayers have the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles by collecting letters, which are distributed throughout the tracks. By spelling \"Nintendo\" with the letters, players upgrade to a better vehicle; players can upgrade from the \"Racer\" to the \"Speed demon\" and then to the Spiker, each of which performs progressively better than the previous vehicle. If players spell \"Nintendo\" while racing with the Spiker, then they win the game.","Genres":{"genre":"Racing"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Nintendo","Developer":"Rare","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/19846-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"640","height":"641","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/19846-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/19846-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"250","height":"244","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/19846-1.png"}}]}},"Super Real Fishing":{},"Super Robot Pinball":{},"Super Robot Taisen":{},"Super Robot Taisen - Link Battler":{},"Super Robot Taisen Final Vol.1":{},"Super SLG":{},"Super Scrabble":{},"Super Street Basketball":{},"Super Street Basketball 2":{},"Supercross Freestyle":{"id":"33099","GameTitle":"Supercross Freestyle","PlatformId":"41","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ReleaseDate":"01/01/2000","Overview":"Supercross Freestyle is a dirt bike racing game.

Blocks are stacked on top of one another and rise steadily toward the top of the playfield, with new blocks being added at the bottom. The player must arrange blocks in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more matching shapes by swapping blocks horizontally two at a time. As matching lines are formed, the blocks are cleared from the screen and any blocks above them fall into the gaps. The game is over when the blocks touch the top of the playfield, or another game-ending condition is met (such as reaching a time limit or clearing blocks below a set line). Clearing more than three tiles in a single move scores a Combo, while Chains are scored when falling blocks from one clear cause another clear to occur. Both of these events score extra bonus points, and in multiplayer Versus games, these also send \"garbage blocks\" to the other player's playfield.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Nintendo Co., Ltd.","Developer":"Intelligent Systems Co., Ltd.","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"3281","PlatformId":"6"}},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/17486-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"640","height":"645","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/17486-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/17486-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"350","height":"349","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/17486-1.jpg"}}]}},"Tetris Blast":{"id":"21329","GameTitle":"Tetris Blast","PlatformId":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1996","Overview":"Have a BLAST!

Its Batman games were almost all excellent, especially the Game Boy release, which combined Mario-style platforms and blockbusting with gunplay. Much of Sunsoft's NES catalogue is also fondly remembered, with titles such as Blaster Master, Journey to Silius and, despite its obscene difficulty, Mr. Gimmick / Gimmick! to name a few. Trip World for the Game Boy is another Sunsoft goodie, regularly featuring on lists for obscure or overlooked games and, in the US at least, lists for import exclusives. Released only in Japan and Europe in small quantities, a boxed copy of the original cartridge now sells for ludicrously high prices. At the time of writing, two unboxed copies were on eBay for around £115 / $180; Yahoo! Auctions Japan had nothing.\r\n\r\nTrip World at first appears to be like any conventional platformer – perhaps a little too conventional. There's an intro showing the Maita Flower from atop Mount Dubious being stolen from an elderly Shabubu who is also kidnapped (a bunny-like creature not to be confused with the culinary shabu-shabu dish). Cue the old creature's grandson, Yacopu, to venture out, save his grandfather and retrieve the flower, thereby bringing peace back to the world. Players move across the screen, avoiding spike pits, jumping along collapsing platforms, and karate kicking enemies... Except the enemies don't seem to fight back. Very few of them in fact cause any damage at all, with only the bosses posing a genuine threat. Apart from the harmless enemies, it's all very standard. Yacopu can collect fruit items which imbue him with special powers: the ability to fire paralysing seeds that sprout from the skulls of enemies; a bouncy ball power-up; and a third which allows him to attack with his tail. These powers are timed and soon wear off, but in some stages it's possible to collect an additional power-up which, when combined with the first, grants something entirely new. The best of which causes Yacopu to sprout legs and gain the ability to fire instant-death projectiles.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Platform"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sunsoft","Developer":"Sunsoft","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/23366-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1000","height":"1011","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/23366-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/23366-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"1071","height":"1080","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/23366-1.png"}}]}},"Triple Play 2001":{"id":"22111","GameTitle":"Triple Play 2001","PlatformId":"41","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy Color","ReleaseDate":"05/08/2000","Overview":"The highly popular baseball series TRIPLE PLAY makes its appearance on the Game Boy Color with TRIPLE PLAY 2001.

Jellystone Park is holding a Balloon Fest and Yogi Bear (that's you!) knows this is the perfect opportunity to grab hold of some delicious picnic baskets. But first you need to clear the skies of a ton of fast-moving, falling balloons. Guide Yogi across the bottom of the screen, sending balloons shooting upwards from your special picnic basket. The object is to align three balloons of the same color together. When you do, all three pop and disappear, your score goes up, and more balloons drop down. Clear the whole stack before they reach the ground or it's game over. If you're quick and clever, you can cause high-scoring chain reaction explosions that will make your job a little easier. When you feel ready, you can go head-to-head against a friend in Link cable mode. YOGI BEAR: Great Balloon Blast is Cartoon Network-licensed, party-popping fun for your Game Boy Color.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Bam Entertainment","Developer":"ITL","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/21930-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"500","height":"500","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/21930-1.png"}}}},"Yogi Bear in Yogi Bear's Goldrush":{"id":"21815","GameTitle":"Yogi Bear's Gold Rush","AlternateTitles":{"title":"Yogi Bear's Goldrush"},"PlatformId":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ReleaseDate":"10/01/1994","Overview":"Yogi Bear's Goldrush is an Action game, developed by Entertainment Int and published by GameTek, which was released in 1994.","Genres":{"genre":"Platform"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"GameTek","Developer":"Entertainment Int","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/21815-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"643","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/21815-1.jpg"}}}},"Yojijukugo 288":{},"Yoku Tsukawareru Eiken 2 Kyuu Level no Kaiwa Hyougen 333":{},"Yoshi":{"id":"13129","GameTitle":"Yoshi","AlternateTitles":{"title":["Mario & Yoshi","Yoshi no Tamago"]},"PlatformId":"4","Platform":"Nintendo Game Boy","ReleaseDate":"07/01/1992","Overview":"In Yoshi, the player is tasked with clearing monsters from the on-screen playing field.

With the exception of the latter two handhelds, all of Thin Chen's games were produced without license from the console manufacturers; the company produced at least 70 unique games for the NES and Famicom and at least 32 for the Game Boy (albeit compiled into eight 4-in-1 cartridges), making it the most prolific unlicensed developer and publisher for both consoles by a considerable margin.[1] The company also produced its own Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clones, such as the Q-Boy.[2]\r\n\r\nMost of Thin Chen's products were released under the \"Sachen\" brand name, although the names Joy Van and Commin were also used for certain early games for the Famicom and handheld consoles respectively. Several of their NES games were released outside Taiwan under license by foreign publishers, including Hacker International in Japan (usually with added pornographic content), Bunch Games/Color Dreams and American Video Entertainment in the USA, and Milmar in Brazil.[1]\r\n\r\nNote: This is taken from wiki, no description for actual game.
