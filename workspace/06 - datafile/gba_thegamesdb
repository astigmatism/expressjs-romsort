The game was not released in America or Europe, but a remake of the game, titled Art Style: ROTOHEX for the Wii's WiiWare service, was released two years later in 2008. The remake was slightly different, though was instantly recognizable to fans of Dialhex.\\r\\n\\r\\nGameplay\\r\\nIn Dialhex, you turn differently colored triangles on a playing field. The goal of the game is to turn them in a way so that you create a hexagon that contains triangles of the same color. After doing so, you'll be rewarded a set amount of points and the triangles within the hexagon will disappear, with the triangles in the surrounding areas taking their place. The board itself is in the shape of a hexagon, and triangles will continually fall down from the top. Once they hit another triangle, they'll stop moving, waiting for the player to make use of them. If the player has destroyed most of the triangles on the stage, and the amount of triangles is a bare minimum, then they can press the L and R button, or the A and B button, at the same time to cause the triangles that drop to come down faster. The triangles will also start to drop faster as the player progresses through the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you start a new game, you'll be given just two colors (in the start, green and orange). After six hexagons have been created, then another color will be added to the mix, and will start to drop down from above.

In endless mode, you'll keep on going for as long as you possibly can, trying to rank up as many points as possible. The game starts similarly to the title's main mode, and new colors will start to drop just as they did in that mode too. The only difference is that it never ends until the player gets a gameover.

Following this your small star will shoot towards a large body with a varying amount of small stars orbiting it. The goal is to come in possession of those other stars in order to increase the size of the primary one. When ready, the player will shoot out of the orbit of a star and then be pulled into another one when he enters its range. If the player touches the star that the smaller ones are revolving around, then your star will blow up. With this said, it's suggested you constantly adjust the speed of your stara as not to rush into an orbit, ultimately causing it to crash.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one wishes to enter the orbit of a star, he'll have to press the A button, which is will \\\"attract\\\" your star towards it.

Basically if it's red, you want to stay away from it. unfortunately using the repel or attract button will have no effect when you're next to an obstacle, though if a star is nearby and you're heading straight towards an obstacle, it's suggested that you get out of its way.

Each game can be played on a background that ranges like a jail, outside of an Old West saloon, and the North Pole with varying terrain like grass, clay, and ice. Games can be played in a two-player mode over a single cart and even up to four players with the support of a Game Boy Advance link cable. It will even support the Game Boy Advance's downloadable link for players without requiring a copy of the game. One of the best ways to play this game is in the arcade mode. This mode lets players use special impressive attacks when they build up their powers. The character called 'Vavoom' can set in motion a flirty ball that will dodge and sidestep swings. Droopy can blast off three balls of terror at once for players to panic over and attempt to retrieve them.

Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka \\\"Doctor Doom\\\" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials. To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.\",\"ESRB\":\"E10+ - Everyone 10+\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Activision\",\"Developer\":\"7 Studios\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"3\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"28464\",\"PlatformId\":\"14\"},{\"id\":\"5431\",\"PlatformId\":\"2\"},{\"id\":\"5402\",\"PlatformId\":\"11\"}]},\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/3462-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/3462-1.jpg\"},\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/3462-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"1516\",\"height\":\"1370\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/3462-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/3462-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"1520\",\"height\":\"1370\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/3462-1.jpg\"}}],\"banner\":{\"_\":\"graphical/3462-g.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"760\",\"height\":\"140\"}},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/3462.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"91\"}}}}","Fantastic 4 - Flame On":"{\"id\":\"25928\",\"GameTitle\":\"Fantastic 4: Flame On\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"11/08/2005\",\"Overview\":\"You are the Human Torch!

The plastic racers are still very popular in Japan, inspiring a video game called CHORO-Q ADVANCE. The U.S. release of the game is called GADGET RACERS, and it's every bit as exciting as the toys that it's based on. Command any of 50 unique vehicles through 40 different courses of obstacles, tricks, and general mayhem. You can customize your racer to meet your specifications, using more than 130 different parts to soup things up upgrade your tires, brakes, steering, engines, and more. Adding to the excitement is the fact that you can get four players competing for glory via a link cable and for Game Boy Advance consoles.

The second game in the series includes a number of paintball pros, different modes, and a level editor. Like the previous game, GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D includes a number of different gameplay modes. Players work as part of a team (either AI-controlled or with friends) to take down the opposing team in a number of different environments. The single-player campaign mode takes it a step further, putting players in charge of forming a paintball team from a number of unknowns and turning them into paintball champions. Along the way, players will face off against big-name paintball players, including Nicky Cuba, Matt Marshall, Peter Utsching, and, eventually, Greg Hasting himself. Between tournaments, players can purchase new equipment for their characters and spend accumulated skill points to increase their statistics. The biggest addition to MAX'D is the level editor. This allows gamers to create their own paintball arenas ranging from small to large, cluttered to open. Players can add bunkers, rocks, trees, picnic tables, and many other items to the field. Each map can be shared online or played with computer-controlled opponents. The ability to create and share custom levels online will keep players coming back to GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D for some time. It provides gamers with everything that makes paintball great without worrying about getting a ball of paint all over their faces.\",\"ESRB\":\"E10+ - Everyone 10+\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Activision\",\"Developer\":\"WXP Inc.\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/25978-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"640\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/25978-1.jpg\"}}}}","Gremlins - Stripe vs. Gizmo":"{\"id\":\"11550\",\"GameTitle\":\"Gremlins: Stripe vs. Gizmo\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"11/27/2002\",\"Overview\":\"In Gizmo's story, the cute Mogwai has to prevent Stripe from ruining Christmas for Kingston Falls by retrieving all the presents that Stripe has stolen.

It has since been ported to a number of other platforms. The Commodore 64 version was released in the U.S. under the title Chop N' Drop.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the game, three karateka fight against each other on a beach, trying to be the first to score six points. After every two rounds, there is a bonus game which is either deflecting bouncing balls or kicking away bombs. The C64 version of the game only has the ball bouncing bonus game, and not the bomb bonus game. The game can be played by one or two human players, at least one fighter is always controlled by the computer. Unlike its predecessor, International Karate, there is only one backdrop. However, different parts of the backdrop can be recoloured to several different themes by the players using specific keystrokes. The Amiga and Atari versions of the game (and possibly other versions, unconfirmed) had a number of \\\"background antics\\\", a Pac-Man would appear, a spider would descend, and a U-boat's periscope would occasionally be seen in the harbour. In addition, pressing the \\\"T\\\" key would cause the trousers of all three protagonists to fall down, after which they would do a double-take. Additionally, it was possible (on the Amiga version, at least) to type in four-letter curse words; the game would respond first by rebuking the player for their use of such language, and upon the second offence would reset the game.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Fighting\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"System 3, studio 3\",\"Developer\":\"System 3, studio 3\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"1\",\"Game\":{\"id\":\"39099\",\"PlatformId\":\"4914\"}},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/44410-1.png\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"450\",\"height\":\"450\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/44410-1.png\"}}}}","International Superstar Soccer":"{\"id\":\"26002\",\"GameTitle\":\"International Superstar Soccer\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"11/23/2001\",\"Overview\":\"International Superstar Soccer is a Sports game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Europe in 2001.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Sports\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Konami\",\"Developer\":\"Konami\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"3\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"21613\",\"PlatformId\":\"4\"},{\"id\":\"37335\",\"PlatformId\":\"11\"},{\"id\":\"3794\",\"PlatformId\":\"6\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/26002-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"641\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/26002-1.jpg\"}}}}","International Superstar Soccer Advance":"{\"id\":\"24003\",\"GameTitle\":\"International Superstar Soccer Advance\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/24/2003\",\"Overview\":\"International Superstar Soccer Advance is a Sports game, developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka and published by Konami, which was released in Europe in 2003.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Sports\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Konami\",\"Developer\":\"Konami\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/24003-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"502\",\"height\":\"500\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/24003-1.jpg\"}}}}","Interracial Lovers JPEG Slideshow":{},"Interrupt Demo by Enfis the Paladin (PD)":{},"InterruptTest by Jonathan S.

Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items.

As the game opens, the crack team of penguin escapees has put the finishing details on their escape plan, which involved digging a tunnel under the zoo and all the way to Antarctica. Of course, this isn't as easy as it sounds, and the penguins will need a number of supplies, items, and help.

While the rangers' fighting abilities are similar, each has his or her own unique power. The Red Ranger can move through objects, the Yellow Ranger can create duplicates of herself, the Green Ranger can see heat trails, the Blue Ranger can create a force field, and the Pink Ranger can replicate objects she touches. There's also a Shadow Ranger who has special abilities players will uncover as they progress through the game. Each level in this platformer has players running, jumping, and attacking enemies as they guide the chosen ranger through the many obstacles that Gruumm has created. Each of the nine levels is controlled by a boss that the Rangers must defeat to move on. After certain levels, the Rangers will summon the Megazord to do battle with giant monsters.

The SNES version has been recently released for download at Virtual Console. It was the first game in the series to introduce new Forces. As well as the original Force (which was now named the Round Force, later named as the Standard Force in R-Type Delta), the player could choose from two other Forces: the Shadow Force and the Cyclone Force. These both had new, different weapon sets and special enhancements.\\r\\nIt also refined the weapons and charging system. It reverted to the original Red-Blue-Yellow weapon system, and the Diffusion Wave Cannon from R-Type II was replaced with a more standard wave cannon. Charging this cannon to full beam strength results in a massive, powerful beam that passes through all enemies and obstacles. A new weapon called the Hyper Wave Cannon was also added to the ship, which the player could use instead of the normal wave cannon if who desired. By switching to Hyper mode and supercharging the wave cannon, the ship temporarily gains the ability to use the Hyper Wave Cannon, which is unique among wave cannons in having a rapid fire capability. The shots fired create damaging explosions, and if the player has collected one or two Bits, they spin around the ship burning with energy. However, this Hyper mode causes the ship to overheat after a short while, and it must subsequently spend seconds cooling down, during which time the wave cannon is inoperative.\\r\\nThe fighter in R-Type III is identified in R-Type Final as the R-9Ø Ragnarök; it was originally referred to as 'R-90'. In fact, the original R-90 has been split into three in Final: the R-9S Strike Bomber has the R-90's basic Standard force unit and first wave cannon, identified as Mega Wave Cannon. Final's version of the R-90 has the Shadow Force and Hyper Wave Cannon, but is unable to choose its Force or switch between Wave Cannons. Finally, the R-9Ø2 Ragnarok II has the R-90's final Force, the Cyclone Force, and the Giga Wave Cannon, which can be charged through 7 loops. It can be assumed that this is because the original R-90 would simply be too powerful for the game to be any kind of challenge.\",\"ESRB\":\"E - Everyone\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Shooter\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"DSI Games\",\"Developer\":\"Irem\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"1\",\"Game\":{\"id\":\"2927\",\"PlatformId\":\"6\"}},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/2345-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"1530\",\"height\":\"1370\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/2345-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/2345-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"1530\",\"height\":\"1370\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/2345-1.jpg\"}}],\"banner\":{\"_\":\"graphical/2345-g.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"760\",\"height\":\"140\"}}}}","R256 by John Sensebe (PD)":{},"RAMSES - Der Sohn des Lichts by Christian Jacq ":{},"RPG No-Name by maestun (20050623) (PD)":{},"RPG Tsukuru Advance":{},"RPGDemo by Royale00 (PD)":{},"RValentine Demo by Nokturn (PD)":{},"RValentine Demo by Nokturn (PD) ":{},"Race by Xenthor for Visoly (PD)":{},"Racer V0.5 by Premandrake (PD)":{},"Racer V2.0 by Premandrake (PD)":{},"Racer Vx.x by Premandrake (PD)":{},"Racer Vx.x by Premandrake (PD) ":{},"Racing Fever":"{\"id\":\"26123\",\"GameTitle\":\"Racing Fever\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/01/2005\",\"Overview\":\"Choose from one of 6 sexy, super-charged vehicles as you speed your way across a variety of challenging tracks in the car of your dreams!\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Racing\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Neko Entertainment\",\"Developer\":\"Naps Team\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/26123-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"400\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/26123-1.jpg\"}}}}","Racing Gears Advance":"{\"id\":\"3580\",\"GameTitle\":\"Racing Gears Advance\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"02/08/2005\",\"Overview\":\"Choose from 12 officially licensed supercars from top manufacturers including Dodge, Lotus, Chevy, Mitsubishi, GM and more.

Players have a cast of characters to select from, most of whom have appeared in previous SSX games. Once players have selected their character, they're off to the slopes to start winning races and performing huge tricks. The main mode has 12 different events players can participate in. Players select the event they want to compete in from the map. There are races, super pipe, big air, and other events, and there's something for everyone. Winning these events nets the player cash which can be used to upgrade their equipment. In addition to winning the race, players want to look good doing it, and that's where the tricks come in. Pull off enough of them, and the player's boost meter fills, rewarding them with some extra power. Complete enough tricks and the character learns new, even more dangerous and impressive tricks.

Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is most common for the RPG genre, units become stronger by fighting enemies or by performing other actions in battle, such as healing allies. These actions give the units experience points (EXP.), which allow them to gain levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Shining Force, each allied unit is represented by a character with his or her own background and personality, much like in the Fire Emblem series. Although there are no \\\"generic\\\" units, except on the enemy side, most characters contribute little or nothing to the plot upon joining the player army.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach allied unit also has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A unit can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the character's level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level.\\r\\n\\r\\nBattle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies' leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player's leader, Max, or if the player chooses to escape the battle by casting Egress. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle's outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the player's army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although Max's death results in the player losing half of their money.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost games in the Shining Force series (with the exceptions of Shining Force CD, all three Game Gear games, all five cell phone games, the Shining Force III premium disc, the Shining Force for Palm Pilot game, and Shining Force Feather) also possess an exploration mode that occurs outside of battle. This gameplay mode is essentially a Japanese-style traditional RPG game, along the lines of Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, although there are no labyrinths and few puzzles to solve. In this mode, the player's army is represented by Max, who is able to walk around, interact with people, find treasure, buy equipment and items, outfit the army, and choose which of the army's members will be used in battle.\",\"ESRB\":\"T - Teen\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":[\"Role-Playing\",\"Strategy\"]},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Sega\",\"Developer\":\"Amusement Vision\",\"Rating\":\"4.5\",\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/3682-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/3682-1.jpg\"},\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/3682-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"1530\",\"height\":\"1370\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/3682-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/3682-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"1530\",\"height\":\"1370\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/3682-1.jpg\"}}],\"banner\":{\"_\":\"graphical/3682-g.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"760\",\"height\":\"140\"}},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/3682.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"163\"}}}}","Shining Friend (4757 Music Box) (PD)":{},"Shining Soul":"{\"id\":\"3683\",\"GameTitle\":\"Shining Soul\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"09/16/2003\",\"Overview\":\"Enter a world of magic and mystery, where your closest allies may sometimes turn out to be your worst enemies.

The GBA game puts players in control of the web-slinging Spider-Man as he does battle with Venom and other enemies while getting help from some familiar superheroes. The story of Spider-Man begins when 15 year old Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider. He soon realizes he has the ability to climb walls and to sense things. Shortly after being bitten, Peter and friend Eddie Brock discover a mysterious black suit that their fathers created before their deaths. Eddie ends up putting on the suit, which turns him into the powerful villain known as Venom. Peter must battle his childhood friend and other villains like the Green Goblin, Carnage, and Electro to save the city. In story mode, players can walk around New York City as much as they wish as they accomplish side-missions or move the plot along. Instead of walking, though, Spider-Man can shoot webs onto tall buildings and swing his way around the city while capturing gang members and stopping crimes. He also must stop Venom's plot and defeat the other villains. Players will also enjoy seeing Spider-Man joined by allies like Wolverine and the Human Torch for some scenes. Fans of the comics will enjoy how ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN draws on the comic style and storyline, while movie fans will like getting to see another chapter in the Spider-Man legacy.\",\"ESRB\":\"E10+ - Everyone 10+\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Activision\",\"Developer\":\"Activision\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"5\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"28513\",\"PlatformId\":\"14\"},{\"id\":\"22132\",\"PlatformId\":\"8\"},{\"id\":\"5446\",\"PlatformId\":\"2\"},{\"id\":\"9409\",\"PlatformId\":\"1\"},{\"id\":\"4770\",\"PlatformId\":\"11\"}]},\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/20823-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/20823-1.jpg\"},\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/20823-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"640\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/20823-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/20823-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"640\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/20823-1.jpg\"}}],\"banner\":{\"_\":\"graphical/20823-g.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"760\",\"height\":\"140\"}},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/20823.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"200\"}}}}","Ultimate Winter Games":"{\"id\":\"4132\",\"GameTitle\":\"Ultimate Winter Games\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/01/2004\",\"Overview\":\"Ultimate Winter Games features four different Olympic-style events to play: Downhill Skiing, Snowboarding, Bobsled, and Curling.

Also, in addition to the nature-made obstacles, the maps may contain land mines which explode when a worm comes close to one, and barrels which explode when shot, spreading out some burning napalm.

The only problem is that they have to use humans in order to access their powerful spells. The main characters are a fourteen-year-old human named Kiyo and a mamodo boy named Zatch. The game offers players the opportunity to play as several different characters as well as several different modes. Like to play air, this does allow for a variety that will keep players engrossed in the world of the game for extended periods of time, but one of the modes allows for a link up to fight it out multiplayer style. In the game a team of players face off against another team in a basic two-dimensional background much like fighter games of the past. In order to win, a team must win two out of three matches, and although the human character is the only one that can take damage the two characters must always move together.
