The board itself is in the shape of a hexagon, and triangles will continually fall down from the top. Once they hit another triangle, they'll stop moving, waiting for the player to make use of them. If the player has destroyed most of the triangles on the stage, and the amount of triangles is a bare minimum, then they can press the L and R button, or the A and B button, at the same time to cause the triangles that drop to come down faster. The triangles will also start to drop faster as the player progresses through the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you start a new game, you'll be given just two colors (in the start, green and orange). After six hexagons have been created, then another color will be added to the mix, and will start to drop down from above. In all, the colors, including the ones mentioned, are green, orange, yellow, red, blue, purple, cyan, and a darker green.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter you've reached a certain point in the game's main mode, you'll be given access to the title's endless mode. In endless mode, you'll keep on going for as long as you possibly can, trying to rank up as many points as possible. The game starts similarly to the title's main mode, and new colors will start to drop just as they did in that mode too. The only difference is that it never ends until the player gets a gameover. In order to unlock the staff credits, you just need to create six cyan hexagons in the game's main mode. After doing this the credits will be available on the game's main screen.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Puzzle\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Nintendo\",\"Developer\":\"skip, Ltd.\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/35803-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"640\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/35803-1.jpg\"}}}}","Bit Generations Digidrive":"{\"id\":\"35807\",\"GameTitle\":\"bit Generations: Digidrive\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"07/27/2006\",\"Overview\":\"bit Generations: Digidrive is a Game Boy Advance video game released in 2006 by Q-Games and Nintendo.

It is an innovative title that has the player consolidating a multitude of planets together in each stage to create on large rock. It was remade on WiiWare under the title of Art Style: ORBIENT, and was the first of at least three titles to be released in the Art Style series.\\r\\n\\r\\nGameplay\\r\\nBefore starting a stage the player will have to choose which galaxy he or she wishes to play within and then the stage. Following this your small star will shoot towards a large body with a varying amount of small stars orbiting it. The goal is to come in possession of those other stars in order to increase the size of the primary one. When ready, the player will shoot out of the orbit of a star and then be pulled into another one when he enters its range. If the player touches the star that the smaller ones are revolving around, then your star will blow up. With this said, it's suggested you constantly adjust the speed of your stara as not to rush into an orbit, ultimately causing it to crash.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one wishes to enter the orbit of a star, he'll have to press the A button, which is will \\\"attract\\\" your star towards it. If you don't want to enter it, then you'll have to press B, which will repel it. If the player wishes to change the position of the camera, then they can use the d-pad.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen not in orbit around a star, you'll simply be floating. This is when you have to use a combination of the attract and repel buttons in order to change your direction. If you're going near a large star, then its orbit will effect the player more than a smaller one would, and you have more of a chance to start revolving around it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are multiple obstacles in the game that are represented by the color red. Basically if it's red, you want to stay away from it. unfortunately using the repel or attract button will have no effect when you're next to an obstacle, though if a star is nearby and you're heading straight towards an obstacle, it's suggested that you get out of its way.

Bubbles can stun the Unira by using a Sound Wave. When they are stunned, Bubbles can push them into a wall to get rid of them and receive points. If Bubbles is hurt by the Unira, she will lose a life. A life is also lost when Bubbles falls into a Black Hole, or when time runs out.

Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka \\\"Doctor Doom\\\" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials. To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.\",\"ESRB\":\"E10+ - Everyone 10+\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Activision\",\"Developer\":\"7 Studios\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"3\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"28464\",\"PlatformId\":\"14\"},{\"id\":\"5431\",\"PlatformId\":\"2\"},{\"id\":\"5402\",\"PlatformId\":\"11\"}]},\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/3462-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/3462-1.jpg\"},\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/3462-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"1516\",\"height\":\"1370\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/3462-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/3462-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"1520\",\"height\":\"1370\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/3462-1.jpg\"}}],\"banner\":{\"_\":\"graphical/3462-g.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"760\",\"height\":\"140\"}},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/3462.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"91\"}}}}","Fantastic 4 - Flame On":"{\"id\":\"25928\",\"GameTitle\":\"Fantastic 4: Flame On\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"11/08/2005\",\"Overview\":\"You are the Human Torch!

Battles take place on a virtual grid where both teams cannot see the other until they choose to attack. The battle system is quite different from other RPGs in this sense, with strategic elements resembling Battleship and Minesweeper. For battling, Dinos are capable of equipping specialized weapons and armor known as Devices.

Renamed Penny Racers for the benefit of American sales, the wind-up cars were built to perform different tricks (wheelies and spins, mostly) when a penny was inserted into their chassis. The plastic racers are still very popular in Japan, inspiring a video game called CHORO-Q ADVANCE. The U.S. release of the game is called GADGET RACERS, and it's every bit as exciting as the toys that it's based on. Command any of 50 unique vehicles through 40 different courses of obstacles, tricks, and general mayhem. You can customize your racer to meet your specifications, using more than 130 different parts to soup things up upgrade your tires, brakes, steering, engines, and more. Adding to the excitement is the fact that you can get four players competing for glory via a link cable and for Game Boy Advance consoles.

New Age Shutsudou is a semi-port/remake of Ganbare Goemon: Shin Sedai Shuumei, containing similar levels and plot to the PlayStation title. New Age Shutsudou was developed and published by Konami Corporation in 2002. The game (as well as Shin Sedai Shuumei) gives the Goemon universe a facelift. It takes place in futuristic Japan, Goemon is skinnier and sports a new hair-do, Ebisumaru is replaced with a shy girl who has a crush on Goemon named Ebisu, and Yae is replaced with Yui, a mermaid-like creature. \\r\\n\\r\\n The Impact scenes take place inside of a large mech.\\r\\nIn terms of gameplay, Goemon: New Age Shutsudou! is a fairly traditional side-scrolling action platformer. The player controls either Goemon or Ebisu, attacking enemies with their respective weapons (which can be leveled up three times in terms of power), and gathering coins. Each level is fairly linear in comparison to earlier Ganbare Goemon titles, and at the end of each level the player is taken to a world map. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome levels differentiate from this formula. These levels put the player in control of different characters. There are side-scrolling shoot-em-up stages starring characters like Sasuke. The weapon power-up system still works identically here, the gameplay style is just shifted. Additionally, there are stages where the player takes control of Yui, a mermaid-like creature. These stages are underwater. \\r\\n\\r\\nNew Age Shutsudou marks the return of the first person Impact scenes, which were previously in some of the Super Famicom Goemon games. These scenes put the player in control of a large mech, fighting other robots.

The second game in the series includes a number of paintball pros, different modes, and a level editor. Like the previous game, GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D includes a number of different gameplay modes. Players work as part of a team (either AI-controlled or with friends) to take down the opposing team in a number of different environments. The single-player campaign mode takes it a step further, putting players in charge of forming a paintball team from a number of unknowns and turning them into paintball champions. Along the way, players will face off against big-name paintball players, including Nicky Cuba, Matt Marshall, Peter Utsching, and, eventually, Greg Hasting himself. Between tournaments, players can purchase new equipment for their characters and spend accumulated skill points to increase their statistics. The biggest addition to MAX'D is the level editor. This allows gamers to create their own paintball arenas ranging from small to large, cluttered to open. Players can add bunkers, rocks, trees, picnic tables, and many other items to the field. Each map can be shared online or played with computer-controlled opponents. The ability to create and share custom levels online will keep players coming back to GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D for some time. It provides gamers with everything that makes paintball great without worrying about getting a ball of paint all over their faces.\",\"ESRB\":\"E10+ - Everyone 10+\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Activision\",\"Developer\":\"WXP Inc.\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/25978-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"640\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/25978-1.jpg\"}}}}","Gremlins - Stripe vs. Gizmo":"{\"id\":\"11550\",\"GameTitle\":\"Gremlins: Stripe vs. Gizmo\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"11/27/2002\",\"Overview\":\"In Gizmo's story, the cute Mogwai has to prevent Stripe from ruining Christmas for Kingston Falls by retrieving all the presents that Stripe has stolen.

After every two rounds, there is a bonus game which is either deflecting bouncing balls or kicking away bombs. The C64 version of the game only has the ball bouncing bonus game, and not the bomb bonus game. The game can be played by one or two human players, at least one fighter is always controlled by the computer. Unlike its predecessor, International Karate, there is only one backdrop. However, different parts of the backdrop can be recoloured to several different themes by the players using specific keystrokes. The Amiga and Atari versions of the game (and possibly other versions, unconfirmed) had a number of \\\"background antics\\\", a Pac-Man would appear, a spider would descend, and a U-boat's periscope would occasionally be seen in the harbour. In addition, pressing the \\\"T\\\" key would cause the trousers of all three protagonists to fall down, after which they would do a double-take. Additionally, it was possible (on the Amiga version, at least) to type in four-letter curse words; the game would respond first by rebuking the player for their use of such language, and upon the second offence would reset the game.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Fighting\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"System 3, studio 3\",\"Developer\":\"System 3, studio 3\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"1\",\"Game\":{\"id\":\"39099\",\"PlatformId\":\"4914\"}},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/44410-1.png\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"450\",\"height\":\"450\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/44410-1.png\"}}}}","International Superstar Soccer":"{\"id\":\"26002\",\"GameTitle\":\"International Superstar Soccer\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"11/23/2001\",\"Overview\":\"International Superstar Soccer is a Sports game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Europe in 2001.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Sports\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Konami\",\"Developer\":\"Konami\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"4\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"21613\",\"PlatformId\":\"4\"},{\"id\":\"46220\",\"PlatformId\":\"10\"},{\"id\":\"37335\",\"PlatformId\":\"11\"},{\"id\":\"3794\",\"PlatformId\":\"6\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/26002-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"641\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/26002-1.jpg\"}}}}","International Superstar Soccer Advance":"{\"id\":\"24003\",\"GameTitle\":\"International Superstar Soccer Advance\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/24/2003\",\"Overview\":\"International Superstar Soccer Advance is a Sports game, developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka and published by Konami, which was released in Europe in 2003.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Sports\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Konami\",\"Developer\":\"Konami\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/24003-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"502\",\"height\":\"500\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/24003-1.jpg\"}}}}","Interracial Lovers JPEG Slideshow":{},"Interrupt Demo by Enfis the Paladin (PD)":{},"InterruptTest by Jonathan S.

Klonoa Heroes was developed by Namco and published by Namco for the Game Boy Advance. Klonoa Heroes is a twist on the traditional Klonoa games, putting Klonoa in a more action role playing game along the lines of Legend of Zelda or Beyond Oasis. The game does have voice acting, as well. Kumiko Watanabe plays Klonoa, Takahiro Sakurai plays Guntz, Shouzou Iizuke plays Pango, and Yutaka Shimaka plays Garlen.\\r\\n\\r\\nKlonoa Heroes' gameplay is very similar to the gameplay of The Legend of Zelda. Players can control one of three characters (Klonoa, Guntz, and Pango) in a top-down perspective, hitting enemies with various attacks (Klonoa with the Wind Ring seen in the platforming games, albeit with a few differences). Guntz uses a handgun, while Pango throws bombs. In addition, these characters can collect more weapons as the game progresses. Every enemy in the game is given a color (either blue or red), and the player must attack that enemy with the corresponding attack (as each weapon has a blue and red attack).\\r\\n\\r\\nKlonoa Heroes also has role playing aspects. Experience points are gathered by picking up Dream Shards after defeating enemies (failure to pick them up results in no experience). Enemies also drop coins, which can be spent on items and weapons. These items can be found in chests scattered throughout the levels, as well. Most items can be used to restore health, but there are various other uses (such as stat benefits). Leveling up also allows the player to distribute points in several different areas (traditional role playing game stats, such as attack, defense, and agility). These changes are not permanent, and can be changed at any time (when not in the middle of a level).\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Role-Playing\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Namco\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/46209-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"500\",\"height\":\"319\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/46209-1.jpg\"}}}}","Knights' Kingdom":{},"Knot by Peter Schraut (PD)":{},"Koala Brothers, The - Outback Adventures":"{\"id\":\"28163\",\"GameTitle\":\"The Koala Brothers: Outback Adventures\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"04/25/2006\",\"Overview\":\"You're never too young for adventure, at least when the Koala Brothers are involved!

As the game opens, the crack team of penguin escapees has put the finishing details on their escape plan, which involved digging a tunnel under the zoo and all the way to Antarctica.

It was released in two countries: France and Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nNapoleon is a Japanese Game Boy Advance launch title developed by Genki and published Nintendo. The game is a real-time strategy, a genre which rarely appeared on consoles at the time, let alone portable platforms. Instead of being an omnipotent being, however, Napoleon lets one play as the historical French leader himself as he rides on horseback to command his troops in battle. Contrary to what the name might imply, the game itself is not historically accurate, as its missions sometimes incorporate things such as monster summons which the player much take care of.\\r\\n\\r\\nNapoleon's gameplay simplifies a number of real-time strategy game conventions while adding some of its own unique traits. Resource gathering, for example, is not a part of the gameplay directly, although there are still limitations imposed on unit building. Troop morale is another factor which the player must take into consideration to ensure that Napoleon's lackeys are fighting optimally. Not only is this a factor in the actual battles themselves, where Napoleon can sometimes utter a war cry, but it's also a component of the game before and after battles, as the lower-ranked commanders Napoleon also brings into battle with him must be monitored for sufficient morale.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, Napoleon can only command his troops by going to each one individually, with the exception of the units which are grouped with another commander. In that case, simply telling the commander what to do is enough to get all of his attached units moving. He can also heal some units and also be healed by sub-commanders as well. Perhaps most importantly of all, though, is the fact that Napoleon's mobility is limited to how fast his horse can travel; any major parts of the battle he needs to attend to must be commuted to manually, instead of more instantaneous methods employed by most other real-time strategy games.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Strategy\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Nintendo\",\"Developer\":\"Genki\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/46471-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"500\",\"height\":\"314\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/46471-1.jpg\"}}}}","Naruto - Konoha Senki":{},"Naruto - Ninja Council":"{\"id\":\"29210\",\"GameTitle\":\"Naruto: Ninja Council\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"03/22/2006\",\"Overview\":\"Action game, based on the Shonen Jump manga.

In the future, Earth has become home to many different alien races. While most of them are peaceful, some are not. In order to protect earth, six teens were called to form the Space Patrol Delta team. Players will control a certain ranger for each of the nine levels. While the rangers' fighting abilities are similar, each has his or her own unique power. The Red Ranger can move through objects, the Yellow Ranger can create duplicates of herself, the Green Ranger can see heat trails, the Blue Ranger can create a force field, and the Pink Ranger can replicate objects she touches. There's also a Shadow Ranger who has special abilities players will uncover as they progress through the game. Each level in this platformer has players running, jumping, and attacking enemies as they guide the chosen ranger through the many obstacles that Gruumm has created. Each of the nine levels is controlled by a boss that the Rangers must defeat to move on. After certain levels, the Rangers will summon the Megazord to do battle with giant monsters.

The SNES version has been recently released for download at Virtual Console. It was the first game in the series to introduce new Forces. As well as the original Force (which was now named the Round Force, later named as the Standard Force in R-Type Delta), the player could choose from two other Forces: the Shadow Force and the Cyclone Force. These both had new, different weapon sets and special enhancements.\\r\\nIt also refined the weapons and charging system. It reverted to the original Red-Blue-Yellow weapon system, and the Diffusion Wave Cannon from R-Type II was replaced with a more standard wave cannon. Charging this cannon to full beam strength results in a massive, powerful beam that passes through all enemies and obstacles. A new weapon called the Hyper Wave Cannon was also added to the ship, which the player could use instead of the normal wave cannon if who desired. By switching to Hyper mode and supercharging the wave cannon, the ship temporarily gains the ability to use the Hyper Wave Cannon, which is unique among wave cannons in having a rapid fire capability. The shots fired create damaging explosions, and if the player has collected one or two Bits, they spin around the ship burning with energy. However, this Hyper mode causes the ship to overheat after a short while, and it must subsequently spend seconds cooling down, during which time the wave cannon is inoperative.\\r\\nThe fighter in R-Type III is identified in R-Type Final as the R-9Ø Ragnarök; it was originally referred to as 'R-90'. In fact, the original R-90 has been split into three in Final: the R-9S Strike Bomber has the R-90's basic Standard force unit and first wave cannon, identified as Mega Wave Cannon.

Rhythm Tengoku contains 48 minigames that put your rhythm to the test in a variety of crazy scenarios.\\r\\n\\r\\nRhythm Tengoku was developed by Nintendo R&D1 and released exclusively in Japan for the GBA in 2006 and in arcades with Sega's help in 2007. Being developed by the same studio responsible for the WarioWare games, Rhythm Tengoku mixes the mini-game based gameplay with rhythm game elements, featuring unusually high-quality music for a GBA game. The game started development in 2004. A 2002 prototype for a GBA drum sequencer was incorporated into Rhythm Tengoku as well: the player can freely drum within the Sound Test or take on 19 drum lessons. (Source)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game contains eight stages with five rhythm games and one remix of the previous five each, adding up to 48 different mini-games total. Each game can be completed without hitting every note perfectly, although doing so will unlock various rhythm-related bonus games and modes, such as a drum set where you have to mimic what the drummer does.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch like the Wario Ware series of games, Rhythm Tengoku is all about following your senses and trying to be aware of various cues in the visuals and audio. This emphasis on sense instead of language makes it quite easy for anyone to pick up and play, even though the game is entirely in Japanese (and consequently only available in the Asian region or through an import website).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, one of the game's levels has you rapping with a computer-controlled character. He'll speak a colour-coded Japanese phrase, and the player must press 'A' in different rhythms. Although the game explains what rhythms to do for which phrase, non-Japanese speaking players can watch hand movements on-screen to figure it out without the need for language.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally, challenges will crop up, asking you to complete a level without any mistakes. Doing so earns you a certificate for that level, and a pink heart with a 'P' on it appears in that level's description.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Music\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Nintendo\",\"Developer\":\"J.P.

Combining racing with tricks, the game allows players to choose from different events and challenges as they desire. The story mode of SSX 3 involves, like the previous entries in the series, becoming the best snowboarder in the world. Players have a cast of characters to select from, most of whom have appeared in previous SSX games. Once players have selected their character, they're off to the slopes to start winning races and performing huge tricks. The main mode has 12 different events players can participate in. Players select the event they want to compete in from the map. There are races, super pipe, big air, and other events, and there's something for everyone. Winning these events nets the player cash which can be used to upgrade their equipment. In addition to winning the race, players want to look good doing it, and that's where the tricks come in. Pull off enough of them, and the player's boost meter fills, rewarding them with some extra power. Complete enough tricks and the character learns new, even more dangerous and impressive tricks. Gamers who love snowboarding will enjoy SSX 3.

It was never released outside of Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nShin Bokura no Taiyou: Gyakushuu no Sabata (aka \\\"Boktai 3\\\") is the third in a line of action-RPG's conceived by Hideo Kojima, for the GBA. Despite never being released outside of Japan, Boktai 3 has garnered a cult following in English-speaking countries, so much so that a fan-translation was released to the internet. It maintains the tradition of utilizing an in-cart solar sensor in gameplay. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn undetermined amount of time after the events of Boktai 2, main character Django finds himself sealed in an underground prison by Sabata. Sabata, falling to the Dark Matter that corrupts his body, has once again sided with the Immortals, a vampiric race, and wishes to release the Beast of Destruction, Vanargand, with the intent of becoming the Beast itself. Django recovers and then sets out on a quest to stop Sabata and the Immortals once again, whether that means killing Sabata or not. \\r\\n \\r\\nBoktai 3, like its two predecessors, is an action-RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players will control Django to traverse an array of different dungeons. Like the first game, Boktai: The Sun is in Your Hand, Django will wield the Gun Del Sol (lit: Gun of the Sun) and swords (a feature introduced in Boktai 2 ), in addition to using light stealth elements such as pressing against walls and distracting enemies with noise to sneak by.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBeing an action-RPG, players can pick up loot, equip various pieces of armor, find weapons, and increase stats. Django has three different stats to upgrade: Vitality (increases Django's Hit Points), Spirit (increases Django's energy capacity when using the Gun Del Sol), and Strength (increases Django's overall attack power with all weapon-types). Armor can be equipped to the head, body, legs, in addition to an accessory. Each piece grants various stat bonuses and/or special effects, while different weapons have different attack powers, special effects, and attack styles.    \\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike Boktai 2, the Gun Del Sol is, once again, customizable with different lenses (change elemental properties), and different frames (change attack style). However, unlike Boktai 2, spears and hammers are no longer availible as melee weapons; the swords, though, now feature a wide array of effects and attack methods.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAs in past entries, the Boktai 3 cartridge holds a solar sensor. With it, players can use actual sunlight to affect the game. When Django is outside in the sunlight--or by some source of sunlight while inside--players can refill the Gun Del Sol's energy meter, dry up small water bodies, hasten or slow wind speed, speed up or delay timed hazards, or create \\\"solar bridges\\\". How much sunlight is hitting the solar sensor is represented by a 10-segment bar at the bottom of the screen.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn dungeons, Django will sneak around, combat enemies, and solve puzzles. Occasionally, the player will find themselves in a \\\"Trap!\\\" room or a Mission, where the player will be put against a mini boss(es), or asked to fulfill certain objectives to proceed, respectively. At the end of each dungeon waits a boss, usually one of the Immortals. Django will be put into a life-or-death struggle in entertaining, diverse fights. When the battle is over, the boss is sealed in a coffin, and Django must then drag the coffin back through the dungeon, to the entrance (usually following a second, otherwise inaccessible, route through). Once there, Django will set up the \\\"Pile Driver\\\", a device used to destroy the Dark Matter that makes up an Immortal--the only way to actually destroy them--in another fight. Here, is one of the times where sunlight hitting the sensor is mandatory . The boss' life will drain only if sunlight gauge has at least one full segment.\\r\\n \\r\\nNew to the series, is the complete lack of explorable land outside dungeons. Past games had a full overworld and/or a central hub-town to run around in, and sometimes mini-dungeons other than the main Immortal dungeons. This game does not. The main town is a series of menus and small \\\"playable\\\" rooms. In between trips between the town and dungeons, are bike segments, new to the franchise, and unique to this game. Players will ride a bike, completely customizable, in a course-like stretch of land, fighting off enemy bikes and avoiding obstacles.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Role-Playing\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Konami\",\"Developer\":\"Kojima Productions\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/46554-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"500\",\"height\":\"317\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/46554-1.jpg\"}}}}","Shin Kisekae Monogatari":"{\"id\":\"46556\",\"GameTitle\":\"Shin Kisekae Monogatari\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"09/05/2003\",\"Overview\":\"Shin Kisekae Monogatari is an Adventure game, published by Marvelous Entertainment, which was released in Japan in 2003.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Adventure\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Marvelous Entertainment\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/46556-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"500\",\"height\":\"319\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/46556-1.jpg\"}}}}","Shin Megami Tensei":"{\"id\":\"20004\",\"GameTitle\":\"Shin Megami Tensei\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"03/28/2003\",\"Overview\":\"The story is set in Tokyo in the year 199X.

Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is most common for the RPG genre, units become stronger by fighting enemies or by performing other actions in battle, such as healing allies. These actions give the units experience points (EXP.), which allow them to gain levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Shining Force, each allied unit is represented by a character with his or her own background and personality, much like in the Fire Emblem series. Although there are no \\\"generic\\\" units, except on the enemy side, most characters contribute little or nothing to the plot upon joining the player army.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach allied unit also has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A unit can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the character's level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level.\\r\\n\\r\\nBattle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies' leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player's leader, Max, or if the player chooses to escape the battle by casting Egress. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle's outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the player's army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although Max's death results in the player losing half of their money.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost games in the Shining Force series (with the exceptions of Shining Force CD, all three Game Gear games, all five cell phone games, the Shining Force III premium disc, the Shining Force for Palm Pilot game, and Shining Force Feather) also possess an exploration mode that occurs outside of battle. This gameplay mode is essentially a Japanese-style traditional RPG game, along the lines of Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, although there are no labyrinths and few puzzles to solve. In this mode, the player's army is represented by Max, who is able to walk around, interact with people, find treasure, buy equipment and items, outfit the army, and choose which of the army's members will be used in battle.\",\"ESRB\":\"T - Teen\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":[\"Role-Playing\",\"Strategy\"]},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Sega\",\"Developer\":\"Amusement Vision\",\"Rating\":\"4.5\",\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/3682-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/3682-1.jpg\"},\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/3682-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"1530\",\"height\":\"1370\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/3682-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/3682-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"1530\",\"height\":\"1370\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/3682-1.jpg\"}}],\"banner\":{\"_\":\"graphical/3682-g.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"760\",\"height\":\"140\"}},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/3682.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"163\"}}}}","Shining Friend (4757 Music Box) (PD)":{},"Shining Soul":"{\"id\":\"3683\",\"GameTitle\":\"Shining Soul\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"09/16/2003\",\"Overview\":\"Enter a world of magic and mystery, where your closest allies may sometimes turn out to be your worst enemies.

Taking place in a kingdom with tomatoes abound, the gameplay is similar to that of the Mario & Luigi series.\\r\\n\\r\\nTomato Adventure, in terms of gameplay mechanics, is the predecessor of the Mario & Luigi series of games, even having its engine reused in the first installment on the GameBoy Advance. Originally developed for the Game Boy Color, Tomato Adventure transitioned to its successor, the Game Boy Advance, when the latter was released. The main difference between the two versions is believed to lie in the quality of audio and graphics, although little substantial information exists on the Game Boy Color version.\\r\\n\\r\\nTomato Adventure incorporates a number of RPG standards such as leveling up and travelling to various places to advance the plot. However, the battle system itself is substantially different than most games in the genre, as players have a more active role in how the fights turn out. During the player's turn, they can select a character's attack and then their target. From there, they must perform one of a number of different minigames which determines how successful the attack is. These range from simple button mashers to stopping a meter at a specific point. While attacks can land without reaching the optimal point, their effectiveness tends to be severed in the process. Additionally, each attack has a separate amount of usage points which dictate how many times the player can use that specific attack before needing to revitalize themselves.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Adventure\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Nintendo\",\"Developer\":\"Graphic Research\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/46609-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"583\",\"height\":\"359\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/46609-1.jpg\"}}}}","Tomb Raider - The Prophecy":"{\"id\":\"4118\",\"GameTitle\":\"Tomb Raider: The Prophecy\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"11/12/2002\",\"Overview\":\"Lara Croft discovers a manuscript which speaks of a mysterious occult magic which will bring desolation on earth in the near future.

Once their player is created and named, gamers move to the court.

However, each lesson costs money, so players will need to quickly enter a low-level tournament to earn some cash. Many of the tournaments won't be available at the beginning, but as players win matches and earn rankings, more difficult tournaments will open up. Eventually, players will find themselves facing off against big name tennis stars like Andy Roddick, Venus Williams, Roger Federer, Maria Sharapova, Lindsay Davenport, and Lleyton Hewitt. Gamers can also play quick games as either singles or doubles, play an exhibition match, play three different mini-games in party mode, and take on friends using the Game Boy Advance link.

The GBA game puts players in control of the web-slinging Spider-Man as he does battle with Venom and other enemies while getting help from some familiar superheroes. The story of Spider-Man begins when 15 year old Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider. He soon realizes he has the ability to climb walls and to sense things. Shortly after being bitten, Peter and friend Eddie Brock discover a mysterious black suit that their fathers created before their deaths. Eddie ends up putting on the suit, which turns him into the powerful villain known as Venom. Peter must battle his childhood friend and other villains like the Green Goblin, Carnage, and Electro to save the city. In story mode, players can walk around New York City as much as they wish as they accomplish side-missions or move the plot along. Instead of walking, though, Spider-Man can shoot webs onto tall buildings and swing his way around the city while capturing gang members and stopping crimes. He also must stop Venom's plot and defeat the other villains. Players will also enjoy seeing Spider-Man joined by allies like Wolverine and the Human Torch for some scenes. Fans of the comics will enjoy how ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN draws on the comic style and storyline, while movie fans will like getting to see another chapter in the Spider-Man legacy.\",\"ESRB\":\"E10+ - Everyone 10+\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Activision\",\"Developer\":\"Activision\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"5\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"28513\",\"PlatformId\":\"14\"},{\"id\":\"22132\",\"PlatformId\":\"8\"},{\"id\":\"5446\",\"PlatformId\":\"2\"},{\"id\":\"9409\",\"PlatformId\":\"1\"},{\"id\":\"4770\",\"PlatformId\":\"11\"}]},\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/20823-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/20823-1.jpg\"},\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/20823-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"640\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/20823-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/20823-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"640\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/20823-1.jpg\"}}],\"banner\":{\"_\":\"graphical/20823-g.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"760\",\"height\":\"140\"}},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/20823.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"200\"}}}}","Ultimate Winter Games":"{\"id\":\"4132\",\"GameTitle\":\"Ultimate Winter Games\",\"PlatformId\":\"5\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Game Boy Advance\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/01/2004\",\"Overview\":\"Ultimate Winter Games features four different Olympic-style events to play: Downhill Skiing, Snowboarding, Bobsled, and Curling.

The worms can walk and jump around and use tools such as the ninja rope and parachute to move to otherwise unreachable locations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worms have an arsenal of dozens of weapons, ranging from longbows to bazookas and from fireball to Holy Hand Grenades. There are also an array of special weapons, such as Armageddon (meteor shower) or the end-all, be-all Concrete Donkey. Some of these weapons are present in the worms' initial arsenal while others can be collected from randomly appearing crates during the game. For some weapons, such as grenades, holding the launching key longer shoots them further. The landscape can be deformed with any weapon, forcing the players to adapt to changing environments. Also, in addition to the nature-made obstacles, the maps may contain land mines which explode when a worm comes close to one, and barrels which explode when shot, spreading out some burning napalm. These often lead to fancy combinations where, for example, a worm is first hit with a grenade and is then thrown against a mine which sets off another worm, which hits a third worm who slips into the water.\",\"ESRB\":\"E - Everyone\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":[\"Strategy\",\"Shooter\"]},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Publisher\":\"Team17\",\"Developer\":\"Team17\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"4\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"34606\",\"PlatformId\":\"4938\"},{\"id\":\"30694\",\"PlatformId\":\"1\"},{\"id\":\"11058\",\"PlatformId\":\"16\"},{\"id\":\"8292\",\"PlatformId\":\"10\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/2353-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"1530\",\"height\":\"1370\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/2353-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/2353-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"1530\",\"height\":\"1370\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/2353-1.jpg\"}}],\"banner\":{\"_\":\"graphical/2353-g.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"760\",\"height\":\"140\"}},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/2353.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"175\"}}}}","Wotch, The - My Sister, Myself by K.I.

The only problem is that they have to use humans in order to access their powerful spells. The main characters are a fourteen-year-old human named Kiyo and a mamodo boy named Zatch.

Like to play air, this does allow for a variety that will keep players engrossed in the world of the game for extended periods of time, but one of the modes allows for a link up to fight it out multiplayer style. In the game a team of players face off against another team in a basic two-dimensional background much like fighter games of the past. In order to win, a team must win two out of three matches, and although the human character is the only one that can take damage the two characters must always move together.
