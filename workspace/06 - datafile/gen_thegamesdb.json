It was later ported to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and Sega Master System. The Sega Mega Drive version was also released on Wii's Virtual Console in 2007. The game appeared in Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3\r\n\r\nAlien Storm is a side-scrolling beat 'em up.[2] The game resembles Golden Axe, with a similar artistic style, three playable characters (a man, a woman, and a novelty character) and pick-up or power-up special attacks. The player (one player only on the Master System version, up to two players on the Mega Drive version, three on the arcade version) selects from the three different characters to embark upon a quest to save the Earth from an alien invasion.\r\n\r\nAll of the Busters are playable from the beginning of the game. There are 6 missions to complete (8 in the Mega Drive version) with several stages, and each mission has the player blasting aliens, from the streets to the mother ship, where the mother of all aliens can be found. This task becomes increasingly difficult with each new mission, and the aliens are capable of hiding inside objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and other items. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people or destroying a UFO.\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which can be shot to collect life or energy. Energy is used specifically to power the energy based attacks of the player's weapon (such as flames or electricity) and to use the much more powerful special weapons.\r\n\r\nIn a similar format as other early Sega arcade games, each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, i.e. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon (Garth's weapon that shoots lightning is replaced with a flame weapon in the Master System version). Special attacks are also included, and vary depending on the character chosen at the start of the game. For instance, Garth summons a U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a ballistic missile strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. However, a large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low.\r\n\r\nThere are few bosses in the game. The arcade original only features a single boss that has three distinct forms. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as two separate bosses. At the end of each mission, the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, similar to the bonus stages of Shinobi and Shadow Dancer, both also by Sega, or a running section that is similar to the side scrolling mode but plays like a horizontal shooter instead with projectile weapons.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raf0jdiWV5I","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sega","Rating":"7","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"31629","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"38080","PlatformId":"4937"},{"id":"4242","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"2687","PlatformId":"35"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/18899-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"908","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/18899-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/18899.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"64"}}}},"Alisia Dragoon":{"id":"4243","GameTitle":"Alisia Dragoon","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"04/23/1992","Overview":"The pace is intense.

This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.\r\n•Shooting Gallery: The name says it all.

The studio also developed three feature films, one television special, three short films and a live-action television adaptation titled Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon. A reboot of the anime series titled Sailor Moon Crystal began simulcasting in 2014. Several companies have developed merchandising based on the series, including light novels, collectible trading card games, action figures, musical theater productions, several collections of soundtracks and a large number of video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release by Kodansha Comics USA in North America, and in Australia and New Zealand by Random House Australia. The entire anime series has been licensed by Viz Media for an English language release in North America and by Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nSince its release, Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon has received wide critical acclaim and has become one of the most popular manga and anime series worldwide. The entire series has sold over 35 million copies worldwide, making of it one of the highest selling shōjo series ever, and reviewers have praised the art, characterization and humor of the story. The anime is popular in several countries and is arguably one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture. Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon is often cited with popularizing the concept of a team of magical girls and for revitalizing the magical girl genre. The franchise is also credited with redefining the genre, as previous magical girls did not use their powers to fight evil and the concept is now considered one of its standard archetypes.","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Fighting"]},"Players":"2","Co-op":"Yes","Publisher":"MA-BA","Developer":"MA-BA","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"33936","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"28784","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/20218-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"250","height":"350","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/20218-1.jpg"}}}},"Blackthorne":{"id":"9074","GameTitle":"Blackthorne","PlatformId":"33","Platform":"Sega 32X","ReleaseDate":"08/24/1995","Overview":"Through the dark vastness of space, exiled prince Kyle Blackthorne returns to Tuul to avenge his murdered father and restore the shattered Lightstone.

When Jason woke up, SOPHIA 3rd NORA MA-02, which he had hidden in an abandoned barn, was in pieces and the parts he had collected four years ago from the Plutonium Boss’ mutant Underbosses were missing. Little did Jason know that there were more Lightning Beings, the kinfolk of the Plutonium Boss, and they were planning to destroy the Earth. These beings started digging towards the Earth’s core in order to shift the planet’s weight off its axis, leading to total annihilation while they sapped the underworld of plutonium. The parts from SOPHIA 3rd were being used to create a template for the robotic army to assist the Lightning Beings in accomplishing their mission. Jason knew he had to stop them, but he also knew he wouldn’t make it without the help of SOPHIA 3rd. Since he couldn’t recover the parts, he decided to redesign & reconstruct it with (assumedly) the help of Eve to better prepare himself for the ordeal facing him. After 29 days, SOPHIA was completely rebuilt and ready for battle again, now known as SOPHIA 4th.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Beings’ footsteps, the group jumped in their new vehicle and headed towards the (presumably) Adirondack Mountains, where their quest began anew.

It is the second game in the NBA Playoffs series of games.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no SNES version for Bulls vs Lakers, the SNES (and first) version of Bulls vs. Blazers was heavily based on Bulls vs Lakers, with the later Mega Drive version introducing a few changes from this.\r\n\r\nBulls vs Lakers introduced a television broadcast-style presentation with a fictional television network, \"EASN\", the Electronic Arts Sports Network. It was the first team basketball game to feature an in-game instant replay feature. Bing Gordon, the Chief Creative Officer of Electronic Arts, was featured as the game announcer. This was also the first game to depict NBA team logos on the courts.\r\n\r\nGameplay[edit]\r\nThe game can be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two modes, \"Exhibition\" or \"Playoffs\". Players could pick from one of the 16 teams that competed in the 1991 NBA Playoffs. Rosters featured many top NBA stars of the time, including Michael Jordan. Games could be configured for 2, 5, 8 or 12 minute quarters.

Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen \"Columns\".\r\n\r\nWhile a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.\r\n\r\nIf, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.\r\n\r\nLike Tetris, the columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with symbols.\r\n\r\nSome ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. \"Flash columns\" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. \"Doubles\" allows two players work together in the same well. \"Time trial\" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sega","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"7","Game":[{"id":"33307","PlatformId":"4929"},{"id":"37991","PlatformId":"24"},{"id":"5738","PlatformId":"20"},{"id":"3085","PlatformId":"35"},{"id":"29108","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"34519","PlatformId":"6"},{"id":"23255","PlatformId":"34"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/465-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/465-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/465-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"891","height":"1259","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/465-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/465-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"912","height":"1258","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/465-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/465.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"128"}}}},"Columns Advanced Sound Test by Drx (PD)":{},"Columns III - Revenge of Columns":{"id":"2486","GameTitle":"Columns III","AlternateTitles":{"title":["Columns III: Revenge of Columns","Columns III: Taiketsu!

The French/Spanish version was renamed Dragon Ball Z: L'Appel du Destin and has the game translated to French language and the instruction booklet in French and Spanish languages. The game was also distributed in Portugal in 1996 where it is simply called Dragon Ball Z. The distributor, Ecofilmes, would take Japanese copies of the game, replace the cover and the manual (but keep the cart), and sell the game as is, promising a free converter cart as the Japanese cartridges cannot fit into European Mega Drives.

The character of Death Adder and the stolen Golden Axe could well be traced to the historical event of the Acquisition of the True Cross during the Sassanid-Byzantine wars, as the Norse mythology is heavily influenced by Greek and Middle Eastern mythologies.\r\nThe player controls one of three Warriors. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two handed broadsword looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a long-sword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder.","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":{"genre":"Adventure"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"Yes","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiHjrQlO2RQ","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sega","Rating":"7","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"10","Game":[{"id":"35889","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"28279","PlatformId":"4914"},{"id":"5481","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"6402","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"14156","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"2799","PlatformId":"35"},{"id":"7505","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"20144","PlatformId":"12"},{"id":"29746","PlatformId":"4955"},{"id":"27715","PlatformId":"4926"}]},"Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/209-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/209-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/209-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/209-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/209-3.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/209-3.jpg"}],"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/209-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"893","height":"1259","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/209-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/209-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"911","height":"1259","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/209-1.jpg"}}],"banner":[{"_":"graphical/209-g.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},{"_":"graphical/209-g2.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}}],"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/209-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/209-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/209-2.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/209-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/209-3.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/209-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/209-4.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/209-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/209-5.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/209-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/209-6.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/209-6.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/209-7.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/209-7.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/209-8.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/209-8.jpg"}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/209.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"250"}}}},"Golden Axe II":{"id":"967","GameTitle":"Golden Axe II","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"12/26/1991","Overview":"The three playable characters from the first Golden Axe, Ax Battler, Tyris Flare, and Gilius Thunderhead, return in Golden Axe II to fight the new evil forces led by Dark Guild.

In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Wisdom Tree","Developer":"Wisdom Tree","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"1868","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"20482","PlatformId":"4"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/20359-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"640","height":"938","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/20359-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/20359-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"480","height":"700","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/20359-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/20359.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"139"}}}},"Journey From Darkness - Strider Returns":{},"Joystick Test Program (PD)":{},"Judge Dredd - The Movie":{"id":"4471","GameTitle":"Judge Dredd","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"08/01/1995","Overview":"Judge Dredd is a platform action game based on the British comic book character of the same name and the 1995 movie that tarnished that name.

He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen.\r\nWhen Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld.\r\nShao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. Eventually with his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm comes back.\r\nMortal Kombat 3 follows Mortal Kombat II and shares continuity with both Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Mortal Kombat Trilogy which were both updates of this game.

The game would have tried to build on the concept of the original arcade game, but feels to some degree more like a very bad approach to the Streets of Rage school of beat-em-ups. It is obvious that it either was in a rather early development stage, or Sega did right to pull the plug on this botched mess.\r\n\r\nThe game features a lot of cut scenes, all of them in the finest Engrish. The chapter titles are in Japanese, though. The story doesn't make any sense, at least not in its presented state.

After Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf was released, subsequent titles were named Tiger Woods PGA Tour and released yearly.\r\n\r\nAlthough EA Sports developed most games in the series internally, some SKUs have come from outside developers including the first edition, Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf, which Adrenalin Entertainment developed in conjunction with EA for the PlayStation and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2001 for the PlayStation, which was developed by Stormfront Studios. IOMO also produced versions of the game for mobile phones for the 2002, 2004, and 2005 editions.\r\n\r\nIn October 2013, EA announced that it would end its relationship with Woods, and be replaced by a new golfer on the next instalment. On March 16, 2015, it was announced that Rory McIlroy—the current top golfer in the world, would become the new title athlete of the franchise, which will now be known as Rory McIlroy PGA Tour.[1][2]\r\n\r\nThe series was responsible for several innovations in the genre, such as the now standard three-click swing method, and in 1995 a critic stated in GamePro that \"The PGA series flies high above the rest for two reasons: You can completely control a shot, and you play on the best courses around.\"[3] However, unlike other games in the EA Sports label, the series was often shadowed by other competitors such as the Jack Nicklaus series, Links series, Microsoft Golf or The Golf Pro","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Co-op":"No","Rating":"7","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"6","Game":[{"id":"10138","PlatformId":"25"},{"id":"21694","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"25167","PlatformId":"20"},{"id":"4555","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"40247","PlatformId":"10"},{"id":"5776","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/28064-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"191","height":"265","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/28064-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/28064.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"126"}}}},"PGA Tour Golf":{"id":"677","GameTitle":"PGA Tour Golf","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1991","Overview":"PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since.

Once full, a fairy will eventually be dropped. Once the fairy comes to a stop by landing on anything, it waves its wand and every ghost in the eight lines below it will disappear, often resulting in numerous lines being completed and simplifying the board. Once the fairy disappears, the score bonus is given, and gameplay continues.\r\n\r\nPac-Attack can also be played in 2-player mode. Player 1 must eat Blinky, while Player 2 must eat Sue, the purple ghost from Pac-Mania. As players eat ghosts and complete lines, they will drop ghosts on their opponent's board, messing up their board and bringing them closer to the top. This game can even be played in puzzle mode. The object of this mode is to smash all 100 stages. If you get a Game Over, all the regular blocks appear with red crosses on them, while Blinky and Sue over backwards laughing silently.

Pac-Man himself walks around in a cartoon world and interacts directly with the player, as well as with objects and other characters. The player cannot control Pac-Man directly, but instead can direct his attention in various directions, and is armed with a slingshot that can be used to strike certain objects, including Pac-Man himself.\r\nPac-Man's mood varies throughout the game, usually in response to his environment or the player's actions, and generally his mood affects his actions and his willingness to cooperate with the player; the varieties of \"bad\" moods can at time compromise the player's ability to progress. There are a few instances, however, where Pac Man is required to be angry. Hitting objects with the slingshot can often get Pac-Man to look at that object and piece together parts of the puzzle he is currently trying to solve - for example, hitting a door may cause Pac-Man to go inside a house to discover a clue. But beware - a few objects when hit can also produce disastrous (and humorous) results. Hitting a trash can on a city street at the wrong time, for example, can cause a cat to jump out and attack Pac-Man.\r\nThroughout the game, Pac-Man is occasionally harassed by the four ghosts from the classic Pac-Man games. When this happens, Pac-Man is paralyzed by fear and eventually faints, unless the player gives him a power pellet. Then Pac-Man becomes Super Pac-Man for a brief time and flies around, eating the ghosts. In some cases, the ghosts may leave behind important objects.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":["Adventure","Puzzle"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Namco","Developer":"Namco","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"3234","PlatformId":"6"}},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/674-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/674-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/674-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"899","height":"1259","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/674-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/674-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"909","height":"1259","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/674-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/674.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"110"}}}},"Pac-Mania":{"id":"4546","GameTitle":"Pac-Mania","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1991","Overview":"Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man.

Sonic the Hedgehog and Tails fly onto the scene to mount an aerial assault, but Sonic is knocked off the wings of Tails' airplane by a blast from the fortress. He falls into the water, but is rescued and taken to the subterranean levels of the Veg-O-Fortress. The fortress must be destroyed from the inside-out, and the only way to make that happen is to trigger an eruption in the volcano it's built on. Sonic knows this can be done by removing the Chaos Emeralds that keep the volcano stable.

The player takes control Strider Hiryu, the youngest elite-class Strider in the organization. Hiryu is summoned by the organization's second-in-command, Vice Director Matic, to assassinate his friend Kain, who has been captured by hostile forces and has become a liability to the Striders. Instead of killing him, Hiryu decides to rescue Kain from his captors. With the help of his fellow Strider Sheena, Hiryu uncovers a conspiracy between a certain faction of the Strider organization led by Matic himself and an unknown organization known simply as the \"Enterprise\" (headed by a man named Faceas Clay) which involves the development of a mind-control weapon codenamed \"Zain\". In the course of finding and destroying these Zain units, Hiryu learns that the faction of conspirators is headed by Vice Director Matic himself. Hiryu eventually tracks Matic to an orbiting space station where the two Striders face off; after a brief battle Hiryu bests Matic and kills him. Afterwards Hiryu locates and destroys the last of the Zain units.\r\n\r\nIn the epilogue, it is revealed that though Hiryu was asked to return to the Strider organization he instead opted to retire. The final credits show him sheathing his weapon and walking away.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Capcom","Developer":"Capcom","Rating":"6","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"14","Game":[{"id":"9509","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"28410","PlatformId":"4914"},{"id":"8272","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"6565","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"20655","PlatformId":"15"},{"id":"20656","PlatformId":"4920"},{"id":"2960","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"19644","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"3034","PlatformId":"35"},{"id":"7502","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"36832","PlatformId":"4913"},{"id":"11438","PlatformId":"10"},{"id":"20653","PlatformId":"12"},{"id":"20654","PlatformId":"4919"}]},"Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/702-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/702-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/702-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/702-2.jpg"}],"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/702-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"906","height":"1254","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/702-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/702-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"917","height":"1254","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/702-1.jpg"}}],"banner":{"_":"graphical/702-g.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-2.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-3.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-4.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-5.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-6.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-6.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-7.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-7.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-8.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-8.jpg"}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/702.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"119"}}}},"Striker":{"id":"34089","GameTitle":"Striker","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1995","Overview":"Striker is a Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear football game.

All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","Developer":"NuFX","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"304","PlatformId":"6"}},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/4641-1.png","$":{"side":"back","width":"461","height":"679","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/4641-1.png"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/4641-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"471","height":"679","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/4641-1.png"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/4641.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"175"}}}},"Super Battle Tank - War in the Gulf":{"id":"34109","GameTitle":"Super Tank War","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","Overview":"Super Tank War is an unlicensed action game developed for the Sega Mega Drive.

There is an internal clock in the game, which makes it necessary for the protagonist to sleep periodically and regain his strength.

Goal! also arrived on the Mega Drive, in the updated form of Dino Dini's Soccer.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"U.S. Gold","Developer":"Tiertex","Rating":"8","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"24127","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"34091","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"3039","PlatformId":"35"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/20533-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"477","height":"670","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/20533-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/20533.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"96"}}}},"Super League 91":{"id":"28103","GameTitle":"Super League","PlatformId":"36","Platform":"Sega Mega Drive","Co-op":"No","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/28103-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"365","height":"508","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/28103-1.jpg"}}}},"Super Mario 2 1998":{"id":"26683","GameTitle":"Super Mario World 64","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1998","Overview":"Super Mario World 64 is a pirated port of the SNES Super Mario World, made for the Mega Drive/Genesis by an unknown developer, at an unknown date (but presumably some time after the original release of Super Mario 64, in 1996).

As in the previous game, players battle waves of enemies by using guns; the arcade version even uses the two-joystick control system of Robotron.

Previously in Street Fighter II: Champion Edition and Street Fighter II: Turbo, whilst the four boss characters were available, they did not have different animations for some punches and kicks. Although this was expected for Balrog (being a boxer), it was unusual to see a character doing a punch when pressing a kick button, or vice-versa.\r\n\r\nAside from the bosses' added moves, some of the main characters' moves were adjusted in some ways. For example, the differences between Ken and Ryu became more defined - Ryu focusing on deadlier fireballs, and Ken's fierce Dragon Punch being able to set opponents on fire.","Genres":{"genre":"Fighting"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Capcom","Developer":"Capcom","Rating":"7.5","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"2792","PlatformId":"6"}},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/28104-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"250","height":"350","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/28104-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/28104-1.jpg","$":{"width":"384","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/28104-1.jpg"}}},"Super Thunder Blade":{"id":"704","GameTitle":"Super Thunder Blade","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"08/14/1989","Overview":"As in its predecessor, the player takes control of an helicopter which is used to attack a group of guerrillas.

When a fish has been caught, it becomes a sensitive play with the line tension to make sure it does not snap shown through the side-view of the fisher. At the end of the day the boat can go back to the weighing area to determine the results. Money earned in the tournaments can be used to acquire new spin reels, bait reels, boats, lines and lures.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"American Softworks","Developer":"Imagitec","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"6304","PlatformId":"6"}},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/4686-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"640","height":"919","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/4686-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/4686-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"483","height":"679","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/4686-1.png"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/4686.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"175"}}}},"TNN Outdoors Bass Tournament '96":{"id":"2574","GameTitle":"TNN Outdoors Bass Tournament '96","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1996","Overview":"TNN Outdoors Bass Tournament '96 is the sequel to TNN Bass Tournament of Champions.

You have two buttons: one to shoot your gun with and one to jump with.

Once all the enemies and boxes are destroyed, the level is complete.\r\n\r\nA port to the SG-1000 Mark III was released in Japan as a launch title for the console (along with Hang-On). It was subsequently released overseas on the Sega Master System, renamed Teddy Boy, which is the same except that the main theme song was changed due to licensing issues. TecToy also released an alternate version only in Brazil called Geraldinho, featuring an edited main character based on the titular protagonist of the popular comic strip.

It was licensed from Atari Games (credited as Tengen) and Mirrorsoft, who held the rights to produce Tetris arcade games at the time. A less powerful version was also released for Sega System E hardware. Both versions are unrelated to Atari's arcade version, released in the same year under the same name.\r\n\r\nSega bizarrely also released versions on Taito's B-System and H-System arcade boards in Japan. The B-System versions were released as upgrade kits for Taito's Nastar and Master of Weapon; the H-System version appears to have been sold on modified boards that previously held Taito's Go for the Gold (released overseas as Recordbreaker) rather than as an upgrade kit.\r\n\r\nSega attempted to port the game to the Sega Mega Drive, however sales were blocked by Nintendo who owned the home console rights to the franchise (they had taken Atari's home console division, Tengen to court over a similar incident on the NES). As such, only about 10 cartridges were produced, all of which were only released in Japan. This version is now a rare collector's item, being sold in auctions for up to US$16000. Because Nintendo had no authority over the arcade versions, the Sega Mega Drive port was brought to Mega-Tech hardware in 1989.","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKHm2W1o_ec","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sanritsu","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"12","Game":[{"id":"9513","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"28258","PlatformId":"4914"},{"id":"8828","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"7538","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"1424","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"10616","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"23081","PlatformId":"4917"},{"id":"27521","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"36886","PlatformId":"4913"},{"id":"20155","PlatformId":"12"},{"id":"24824","PlatformId":"13"},{"id":"27765","PlatformId":"4926"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/20441-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"180","height":"256","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/20441-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/20441.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"147"}}}},"Theme Park":{"id":"4679","GameTitle":"Theme Park","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"03/01/1995","Overview":"Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog.

Some years later, development documents were acquired and a prototype ROM was released to the general public in July 2013. [1]\r\n\r\nIt is not known why the Mega Drive version of the game was cancelled - a Super Nintendo version was released in North America and Europe in early 1994, suggesting the Mega Drive version was originally set to be released around this period. Malibu would be sold to GameTek in the coming months which may explain its disappearance. A different Time Trax was released for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum in 1986.\r\n\r\nThe game is notable for its use of a relatively advanced sound driver designed by Dean Belfield for Follin - one which was never used in any other Mega Drive games neither before or since. The SNES version uses an entirely different soundtrack.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Black Perl Software","Developer":"Malibu Interactive","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"6300","PlatformId":"6"}},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/34324-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"306","height":"423","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/34324-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/34324-1.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/34324-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/34324-2.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/34324-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/34324-3.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/34324-3.jpg"}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/34324.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"72"}}}},"Tinhead":{},"Tintin Au Tibet":{"id":"7615","GameTitle":"Tintin au Tibet","AlternateTitles":{"title":["Tintin in Tibet","Tim in Tibet","Kuifje in Tibet"]},"PlatformId":"36","Platform":"Sega Mega Drive","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1995","Overview":"A platform game starring Tintin.
