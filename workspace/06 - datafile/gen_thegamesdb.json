A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.\r\n•Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.\r\n•The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping.

This version was never released outside Japan.\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\nBishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon (\"Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon\" or \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon\") is the first video game adaptation of the popular anime of the same name, which in turn was based on a shoujo manga about female high school students who transform into superheroes with planet-related names.\r\n\r\nBishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon was developed by Arc System Works, back when they were a contract developer producing licensed games for other publishers, and published by Angel (a subsidiary of Bandai) in Japan in August 1993. The game was later released in France as Sailor Moon, mirroring the earlier France-only release of another SNES anime license game Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden (which was simply named Dragon Ball Z in France). The game did not receive a UK or US release.\r\n\r\nBishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon would also receive a Sega Mega Drive port in 1994, which was developed and published by Ma-Ba (another Bandai subsidiary). It replaced some of the graphics and stages, and almost all of the music. It also included a new final boss, who only appeared on the game's Hard Mode.\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\nThe game is a fairly standard brawler, with five playable characters. They include:\r\n\r\nSailor Moon - The heroine of the franchise, recognizable by her long blonde pigtails. Standard all-rounder character.\r\nSailor Mercury - The short-haired brunette and the brains of the outfit. She's faster than the other characters, but she's also the smallest and has the shortest reach.\r\nSailor Mars - The long-haired brunette. Sailor Mars is feisty and musically-inclined, and most of her repertoire involves fire in some capacity. Her regular attack is a stronger kick, rather than a punch.\r\nSailor Jupiter - Wears her brown hair in a ponytail. The muscles of the group, Jupiter's attacks are the strongest of any of the playable characters.\r\nSailor Venus - The other blonde. She uses a chain in battle, and is the only character to use a weapon. This gives her a longer reach than the other characters.\r\nThe player, as any one of the five Sailor Soldiers, must progress through five different stages which culminates with a trip to the Dark Kingdom to fight Queen Beryl. Each character fights slightly differently, and each has a different special attack which requires charging up before they can be unleashed. Each character also has a special attack that consumes health when used.","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Fighting"]},"Players":"2","Co-op":"Yes","Publisher":"MA-BA","Developer":"Arc System Works","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"33936","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"28784","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/20218-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"250","height":"350","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/20218-1.jpg"}}}},"Blackthorne":{"id":"9074","GameTitle":"Blackthorne","PlatformId":"33","Platform":"Sega 32X","ReleaseDate":"08/24/1995","Overview":"Through the dark vastness of space, exiled prince Kyle Blackthorne returns to Tuul to avenge his murdered father and restore the shattered Lightstone.

It is the second game in the NBA Playoffs series of games.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no SNES version for Bulls vs Lakers, the SNES (and first) version of Bulls vs. Blazers was heavily based on Bulls vs Lakers, with the later Mega Drive version introducing a few changes from this.\r\n\r\nBulls vs Lakers introduced a television broadcast-style presentation with a fictional television network, \"EASN\", the Electronic Arts Sports Network. It was the first team basketball game to feature an in-game instant replay feature. Bing Gordon, the Chief Creative Officer of Electronic Arts, was featured as the game announcer. This was also the first game to depict NBA team logos on the courts.\r\n\r\nGameplay[edit]\r\nThe game can be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two modes, \"Exhibition\" or \"Playoffs\". Players could pick from one of the 16 teams that competed in the 1991 NBA Playoffs. Rosters featured many top NBA stars of the time, including Michael Jordan. Games could be configured for 2, 5, 8 or 12 minute quarters.

Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen \"Columns\".\r\n\r\nWhile a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.\r\n\r\nIf, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.\r\n\r\nLike Tetris, the columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with symbols.\r\n\r\nSome ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. \"Flash columns\" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. \"Doubles\" allows two players work together in the same well. \"Time trial\" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sega","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"8","Game":[{"id":"41180","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"33307","PlatformId":"4929"},{"id":"37991","PlatformId":"24"},{"id":"5738","PlatformId":"20"},{"id":"3085","PlatformId":"35"},{"id":"29108","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"34519","PlatformId":"6"},{"id":"23255","PlatformId":"34"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/465-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/465-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/465-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"891","height":"1259","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/465-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/465-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"912","height":"1258","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/465-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/465.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"128"}}}},"Columns Advanced Sound Test by Drx (PD)":{},"Columns III - Revenge of Columns":{"id":"2486","GameTitle":"Columns III","AlternateTitles":{"title":["Columns III: Revenge of Columns","Columns III: Taiketsu!

While Naxat furthered the series itself, Tengen would later release a sequel, Dragon's Revenge, not under license from anyone.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Developer":"Tecnosoft","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/29382-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1440","height":"2020","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/29382-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/29382-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1440","height":"2020","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/29382-1.jpg"}}]}},"Devilish - The Next Possession":{"id":"4336","GameTitle":"Devilish: The Next Possession","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1992","Overview":"\"Devilish\" is different from other paddle games by letting you play with two paddles.

These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively.\r\nThough the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US — therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).\r\n\r\nGameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Wisdom Tree","Developer":"Wisdom Tree","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"1820","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"36159","PlatformId":"4"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/20358-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"567","height":"800","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/20358-1.png"}}}},"Eye of Time Demo by FlemTeam (PD)":{},"F-117 Night Storm":{"id":"4368","GameTitle":"F-117 Night Storm","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1993","Overview":"This game allows the player to take control of an F-117A Stealth Fighter.

There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit. Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually. Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time. This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes. A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game.

Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy, but the second harms him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at the next hit he loses a life. There are some extra objects, like Olympic torches, and eggs that hatch either objects for bonus points, trampolines or morph points to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or traps. Izzy can also morph into a glider, a baseball player, an archer or a rocket, among others, to overcome some sections of the levels.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Platform"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"U.S. Gold","Developer":"Alexandria","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"3798","PlatformId":"6"}},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/4457-1.png","$":{"side":"back","width":"483","height":"679","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/4457-1.png"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/4457-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"485","height":"679","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/4457-1.png"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/4457.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"162"}}}},"J.

The updated version featured new tracks combined with some updated tracks from Micro Machines 2.

The tournament featured in the story actually takes place fully at Shang Tsung's Island, located somewhere on Earth, with seven of its locations serving as Kombat Zones.","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":{"genre":"Fighting"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Midway","Developer":"Midway","Rating":"8.5","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"14","Game":[{"id":"9538","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"7193","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"6095","PlatformId":"14"},{"id":"17828","PlatformId":"15"},{"id":"13103","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"14255","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"5065","PlatformId":"21"},{"id":"13768","PlatformId":"20"},{"id":"2926","PlatformId":"35"},{"id":"7194","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"7378","PlatformId":"11"},{"id":"6768","PlatformId":"12"},{"id":"10784","PlatformId":"39"},{"id":"2826","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/653-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/653-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/653-2.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1493","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/653-2.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/653-2.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1546","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/653-2.jpg"}}],"banner":{"_":"graphical/653-g.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/653.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"88"}}}},"Mortal Kombat 3":{"id":"651","GameTitle":"Mortal Kombat 3","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"04/01/1995","Overview":"Fed up with continuous losses in tournament battle, Shao Kahn, who had lost to Liu Kang in the Outworld tournament, enacts a 10,000 year-old plan. He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen.\r\nWhen Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld.\r\nShao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. Eventually with his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm comes back.\r\nMortal Kombat 3 follows Mortal Kombat II and shares continuity with both Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Mortal Kombat Trilogy which were both updates of this game.

It was released on October 31, 1996 and was the successor to NHL 96. It is the sixth installment of the NHL series and the first to be released on both PlayStation and Saturn.\r\n\r\n\r\nNHL 97 took the graphics even further ahead, using a full 3D engine, with motion captured polygonal players (PC/PlayStation/Saturn versions only, the Mega Drive and SNES versions retained similar graphical values to previous games, but with further enhanced animations). Each goaltender has his own custom-painted mask and the original artwork can be seen inside the game with a special \"Goalie Mask Viewer\". NHL 97 also introduces play-by-play commentary, provided by well-known announcer Jim Hughson.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since EA Hockey, national teams were added, but only Canada, the United States, and Russia have their own teams while the other two are selections of the best European players. NHL 97 introduced a skills competition, allowing the user to pick players to compete in drills such as hardest shot, goalie 2 on 0, and accuracy shooting, among others.\r\n\r\nThis was the first year of the \"Third Jersey.\" Teams that had available third jerseys for NHL 97 were, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Boston Bruins, Los Angeles Kings, Pittsburgh Penguins & Vancouver Canucks. These were the first teams to try out the third jersey. To activate the alternate uniform left click on the teams banner in the controller setup.\r\n\r\nIn addition, each team in the game had one player with a special skill. Examples are Joe Sakic's (Colorado Avalanche) \"wrong-footed wrist shot\" and Rob Ray's (Buffalo Sabres) ability to check an opposing player while still controlling the puck. A major flaw in the game was the glitch that allowed players to score 100% of the time when shooting down by taking a shot against the boards at the hash marks of the left circle in the bottom zone.\r\n\r\nAlong with the PC, Mega Drive/Genesis and SNES versions, both the Sega Saturn and PlayStation version made their debut, although they were rushed and buggy. For instance, the shot speed in the PlayStation and Saturn versions was so slow that some skaters could beat a slapshot down the ice.

Pac-Man himself walks around in a cartoon world and interacts directly with the player, as well as with objects and other characters. The player cannot control Pac-Man directly, but instead can direct his attention in various directions, and is armed with a slingshot that can be used to strike certain objects, including Pac-Man himself.\r\nPac-Man's mood varies throughout the game, usually in response to his environment or the player's actions, and generally his mood affects his actions and his willingness to cooperate with the player; the varieties of \"bad\" moods can at time compromise the player's ability to progress. There are a few instances, however, where Pac Man is required to be angry. Hitting objects with the slingshot can often get Pac-Man to look at that object and piece together parts of the puzzle he is currently trying to solve - for example, hitting a door may cause Pac-Man to go inside a house to discover a clue. But beware - a few objects when hit can also produce disastrous (and humorous) results. Hitting a trash can on a city street at the wrong time, for example, can cause a cat to jump out and attack Pac-Man.\r\nThroughout the game, Pac-Man is occasionally harassed by the four ghosts from the classic Pac-Man games. When this happens, Pac-Man is paralyzed by fear and eventually faints, unless the player gives him a power pellet. Then Pac-Man becomes Super Pac-Man for a brief time and flies around, eating the ghosts. In some cases, the ghosts may leave behind important objects.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Adventure"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Namco","Developer":"Namco","Rating":"6","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/29146-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"300","height":"416","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/29146-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/29146.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"110"}}}},"Pac-Mania":{"id":"4546","GameTitle":"Pac-Mania","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1991","Overview":"Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man.

The game also has no predetermined end, although as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to recruit crew members. Also, as the player character ages, fighting becomes more difficult, and deteriorating health will eventually force the character into retirement. The game ends when the player retires, at which point he is given a position in his future life, from beggar to King's adviser, based on accumulated wealth, land, rank, marital status, and other accomplishments.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Adventure","Strategy"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"MicroProse","Developer":"MicroProse","Rating":"7","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"10236","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"20720","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"28922","PlatformId":"36"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/969-2.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1446","height":"2036","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/969-2.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/969-2.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1429","height":"2036","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/969-2.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/969.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"148"}}}},"Pit Fighter":{"id":"680","GameTitle":"Pit-Fighter","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"1990","Overview":"The player begins Pit-Fighter by choosing one of the three playable characters, who all have different moves, speed, and power.

Fuel drums, repair kits and ammunition depletion are both factors to keep in mind, and careful planning of where the pickups are located so that the chopper is able to stay in the air and is able to keep fighting, elements that are very similar in implementation to the Strike series. Differences between the games include the fact that as your systems get damaged, your helicopter becomes harder to control and the weapon and radar systems become affected.","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Time Warner","Developer":"Zyrinx","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"35533","PlatformId":"36"}},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/4593-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1527","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/4593-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/4593-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1533","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/4593-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/4593.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"97"}}}},"Ren and Stimpy Show, The - Stimpy's Invention":{"id":"732","GameTitle":"The Ren & Stimpy Show Presents: Stimpy's Invention","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"1993","Overview":"In one player the player controls either Ren or Stimpy and the computer controls the other character who will simply follow; however, the player can swap the character they control at almost any time during game play.

You begin the game inside a training simulation, which upon successful completion ensures your transfer to the crew of the seaQuest DSV where you will be called upon to perform the same duties.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, your function is to navigate the seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the underwater map to various 'mission areas' where you will be called upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous place.\r\n\r\nThe vehicles you have at your command includeSpeeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up & down and change orientation between facing left and facing right\r\nStinger: A prototype \"next generation\" attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.\r\nSea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport.

It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches\r\nDarwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Cosmo","Developer":"THQ","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"21720","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"27088","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"5825","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/4612-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/4612-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/4612-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"548","height":"778","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/4612-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/4612-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"360","height":"500","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/4612-1.png"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/4612.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"175"}}}},"Second Samurai, The":{"id":"20461","GameTitle":"Second Samurai","PlatformId":"36","Platform":"Sega Mega Drive","Overview":"The Second Samurai is a beat-em-up developed by Vivid Image and Psygnosis and released exclusively in Europe for the Commodore Amiga (1993) and Sega Mega Drive (1994).

The player takes control Strider Hiryu, the youngest elite-class Strider in the organization. Hiryu is summoned by the organization's second-in-command, Vice Director Matic, to assassinate his friend Kain, who has been captured by hostile forces and has become a liability to the Striders. Instead of killing him, Hiryu decides to rescue Kain from his captors. With the help of his fellow Strider Sheena, Hiryu uncovers a conspiracy between a certain faction of the Strider organization led by Matic himself and an unknown organization known simply as the \"Enterprise\" (headed by a man named Faceas Clay) which involves the development of a mind-control weapon codenamed \"Zain\". In the course of finding and destroying these Zain units, Hiryu learns that the faction of conspirators is headed by Vice Director Matic himself. Hiryu eventually tracks Matic to an orbiting space station where the two Striders face off; after a brief battle Hiryu bests Matic and kills him. Afterwards Hiryu locates and destroys the last of the Zain units.\r\n\r\nIn the epilogue, it is revealed that though Hiryu was asked to return to the Strider organization he instead opted to retire. The final credits show him sheathing his weapon and walking away.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Capcom","Developer":"Capcom","Rating":"6","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"14","Game":[{"id":"9509","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"28410","PlatformId":"4914"},{"id":"8272","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"6565","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"20655","PlatformId":"15"},{"id":"20656","PlatformId":"4920"},{"id":"2960","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"19644","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"3034","PlatformId":"35"},{"id":"7502","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"36832","PlatformId":"4913"},{"id":"11438","PlatformId":"10"},{"id":"20653","PlatformId":"12"},{"id":"20654","PlatformId":"4919"}]},"Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/702-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/702-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/702-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/702-2.jpg"}],"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/702-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"906","height":"1254","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/702-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/702-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"917","height":"1254","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/702-1.jpg"}}],"banner":{"_":"graphical/702-g.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-2.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-3.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-4.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-5.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-6.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-6.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-7.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-7.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/702-8.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/702-8.jpg"}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/702.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"119"}}}},"Striker":{"id":"20531","GameTitle":"Striker","PlatformId":"36","Platform":"Sega Mega Drive","Overview":"Striker is a Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear football game.

All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","Developer":"NuFX","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"304","PlatformId":"6"}},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/4641-1.png","$":{"side":"back","width":"461","height":"679","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/4641-1.png"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/4641-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"471","height":"679","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/4641-1.png"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/4641.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"175"}}}},"Super Battle Tank - War in the Gulf":{"id":"34109","GameTitle":"Super Tank War","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","Overview":"Super Tank War is an unlicensed action game developed for the Sega Mega Drive.

Character creation allows the player to choose one of the four character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, the protagonist uses melee or long-ranged weapons or casts magic spells. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player is required to press the attack button during melee combat, instead of simply \"bumping\" into the enemies. There is an internal clock in the game, which makes it necessary for the protagonist to sleep periodically and regain his strength. The main character also has to eat from time to time, otherwise his hit points will gradually decrease. The morality system from the previous game returns: killing friendly creatures will reduce the player's morality level, which will eventually have an effect on one of the game's most decisive battles.","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Role-Playing"]},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Seismic","Developer":"T&E Soft","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"41598","PlatformId":"36"}},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/4644-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1563","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/4644-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/4644-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1530","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/4644-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/4644.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"175"}}}},"Super Kick Off":{"id":"20533","GameTitle":"Super Kick Off","PlatformId":"36","Platform":"Sega Mega Drive","Overview":"Super Kick Off is a football game for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear, released exclusively in Europe and Brazil.

Previously in Street Fighter II: Champion Edition and Street Fighter II: Turbo, whilst the four boss characters were available, they did not have different animations for some punches and kicks. Although this was expected for Balrog (being a boxer), it was unusual to see a character doing a punch when pressing a kick button, or vice-versa.\r\n\r\nAside from the bosses' added moves, some of the main characters' moves were adjusted in some ways.

In addition, the player can use items such as medikits to heal his agents, scanners to locate pedestrians/vehicles and the \"Persuadertron\" to brainwash the player's targets into blind obedience.","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":{"genre":["Strategy","Shooter"]},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","Developer":"Bullfrog Productions","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"9","Game":[{"id":"4878","PlatformId":"25"},{"id":"9512","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"3986","PlatformId":"28"},{"id":"12146","PlatformId":"15"},{"id":"9256","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"34314","PlatformId":"21"},{"id":"41838","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"12334","PlatformId":"12"},{"id":"6229","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/706-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"897","height":"1243","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/706-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/706-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"915","height":"1243","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/706-1.jpg"}}],"banner":{"_":"graphical/706-g.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/706-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"448"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/706-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/706-2.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"448"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/706-2.jpg"}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/706.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"116"}}}},"T-MEK":{"id":"9081","GameTitle":"T-MEK","AlternateTitles":{"title":"T-Mek"},"PlatformId":"33","Platform":"Sega 32X","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1995","Overview":"T-Mek is essentially an updated Battlezone.

The game was endorsed by Japanese singer Yohko Ishino, whose song of the same name was both the source of its title and the music in the background. (Consequently, the game is incorrectly known as Teddy Boy Blues: Yohko Ishino to many English speakers.)\r\n\r\nIn this game, you play as a kid who must destroy boxes from which enemies come out. You have two buttons: one to shoot your gun with and one to jump with. Shots from your gun may be used to \"destroy\" enemies (they become items that can be collected for points), destroy barricades (which are always blue), and (with enough hits) destroy the boxes, which resemble dice counting down the number of hits needed to destroy them. Once all the enemies and boxes are destroyed, the level is complete.\r\n\r\nA port to the SG-1000 Mark III was released in Japan as a launch title for the console (along with Hang-On). It was subsequently released overseas on the Sega Master System, renamed Teddy Boy, which is the same except that the main theme song was changed due to licensing issues.

It was licensed from Atari Games (credited as Tengen) and Mirrorsoft, who held the rights to produce Tetris arcade games at the time. A less powerful version was also released for Sega System E hardware. Both versions are unrelated to Atari's arcade version, released in the same year under the same name.\r\n\r\nSega bizarrely also released versions on Taito's B-System and H-System arcade boards in Japan. The B-System versions were released as upgrade kits for Taito's Nastar and Master of Weapon; the H-System version appears to have been sold on modified boards that previously held Taito's Go for the Gold (released overseas as Recordbreaker) rather than as an upgrade kit.\r\n\r\nSega attempted to port the game to the Sega Mega Drive, however sales were blocked by Nintendo who owned the home console rights to the franchise (they had taken Atari's home console division, Tengen to court over a similar incident on the NES). As such, only about 10 cartridges were produced, all of which were only released in Japan. This version is now a rare collector's item, being sold in auctions for up to US$16000. Because Nintendo had no authority over the arcade versions, the Sega Mega Drive port was brought to Mega-Tech hardware in 1989.","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKHm2W1o_ec","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sanritsu","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"13","Game":[{"id":"9513","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"28258","PlatformId":"4914"},{"id":"8828","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"7538","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"41396","PlatformId":"4912"},{"id":"1424","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"10616","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"23081","PlatformId":"4917"},{"id":"27521","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"36886","PlatformId":"4913"},{"id":"20155","PlatformId":"12"},{"id":"24824","PlatformId":"13"},{"id":"27765","PlatformId":"4926"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/20441-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"180","height":"256","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/20441-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/20441.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"147"}}}},"Theme Park":{"id":"4679","GameTitle":"Theme Park","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"03/01/1995","Overview":"Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog.

Their speech features California slang. The game is set to a soundtrack which has been described both as jazz-funk, and as hip hop. For the game's unique sound, composer John Baker was inspired by Herbie Hancock and The Headhunters.\r\n\r\nIn the game's opening sequence, ToeJam explains that Earl's erratic piloting abilities have resulted in a crash-landing on Earth. He says that they must find the pieces of their spacecraft's wreckage to return to their home planet, Funkotron. The player guides the characters as they avoid Earth's antagonistic inhabitants and search for the debris. Should the player succeed, the final sequence depicts ToeJam and Earl escaping the planet in their reconstructed spacecraft. Under the player's control, the characters proceed across a purple landscape that represents Funkotron, and are greeted by their friends and family.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"Yes","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Johnson Voorsanger Productions","Rating":"7","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"16471","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"35431","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"16472","PlatformId":"12"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/2289-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/2289-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/2289-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1527","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/2289-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/2289-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1533","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/2289-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/2289-1.jpg","$":{"width":"430","height":"309"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/2289-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/2289-2.jpg","$":{"width":"438","height":"318"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/2289-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/2289-3.jpg","$":{"width":"431","height":"305"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/2289-3.jpg"}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/2289.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"100"}}}},"Toejam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron":{"id":"716","GameTitle":"ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron","PlatformId":"18","Platform":"Sega Genesis","ReleaseDate":"04/01/1993","Overview":"The plot of the game follows on from that of its predecessor, which followed the adventures of alien protagonists ToeJam and Earl after they crash landed on Earth.

It is also reported that Sega of Japan were not keen on use of the \"Virtua\" in the game's name, possibly so that the game was not associated with Sega AM2's Virtua Fighter and Virtua Racing. An alternate box mock-up uses the title Virtual Hamster instead.\r\n\r\nIn August 2009, Ryo Suzuki of SEGASaturno.com dumped an early prototype version of this game. In it, the only selectable character is hamster, Chip, and there is only one empty level (though there are numerous non-moving 3D models of other characters and items dotted around the map).
