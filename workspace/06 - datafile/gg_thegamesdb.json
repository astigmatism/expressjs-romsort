Fortunately, Princess Iris can escape with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the crystal and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn.\r\n\r\nGameplay in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player fights in turn-based battles controlling different characters like fighters, healers, rangers and mages, all with different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting for up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: \"battle\" (attack), \"retreat\", \"spell\" and \"monster\". While the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the \"monster\" command is interesting. Whenever a non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master. In-between battles the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party members.","Genres":{"genre":["Role-Playing","Strategy"]},"Players":"2","Co-op":"Yes","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ylN6ASyjeE","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sega","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/15969-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"211","height":"300","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/15969-1.jpg"}}}},"Cutthroat Island":{"id":"24284","GameTitle":"Cutthroat Island","PlatformId":"20","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1995","Overview":"Sharpen your long swords for the ultimate high seas battle!

It is, however, the fourth game in the series; being preceeded by the 1979 arcade game, Galaxian, Galaga in 1981 and finally Gaplus in 1984 (sometimes called Galaga 3 - an equally misleading title). To make matters worse, Namco released an arcade sequel called Galaxian³ (also known as Galaxian 3') in 1990, and the TurboGrafx-16 port of Galaga '88/'91 is called Galaga '90. More recent games have opted to avoid numbering systems and always use the Galaga name.\r\n\r\nGalaga '88/'91 builds on the gameplay seen in Galaxian, Galaga and Gaplus, the most notable addition being the inclusion of more detailed backgrounds (as opposed to coloured scrolling starfields).

The player drives in the fictional Domark team with James Tripp (a programmer within Domark and producer of the game billed as Jim Tripp), facing drivers such as Riccardo Patrese and Michael Schumacher (Benetton), Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger (Ferrari), Mark Blundell and Martin Brundle (Ligier), Johnny Herbert and Alessandro Zanardi (Lotus), Michael Andretti and Mika Häkkinen (McLaren), Andrea de Cesaris and Ukyo Katayama (Tyrrell) and finally Damon Hill and Alain Prost (Williams). Ayrton Senna (then in McLaren) is absent due to his endorsement to Sega's Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II.\r\n\r\nThere are 12 tracks: Interlagos, Imola, Barcelona, Monte Carlo, Montreal, Castelet, Silverstone, Hockenheim, Spa, Monza, Estoril and Adelaide. Compared to the real 1993 season, several tracks are missing, such as Kyalami, Donington Park, Magny-Cours (replaced by Castelet), Hungaroring and Suzuka, but the order of the races is correct. While the track layouts are correct as of 1993, due to the impossibility of actually replicate the physics behind a Formula One car all tracks are filled with obstacles close to the track, such as signs, adboards or platforms above the track to increase the difficulty level, and are 7 laps long.\r\n\r\nThe player can train on a given track, play an arcade mode (where points are given for overtaking and running, and subtracted for being overtaken) or the whole championship, that can be composed by any number of tracks, from just one to the complete twelve. There are four difficulty levels (Novice, Amateur, Professional and Expert), each one of each increases not only the player and competitors' speed, but also decreases the damage tolerance of the car. In addition to a 2 player Split-screen mode, a \"turbo\" mode allowed to increase the sense of speed by reducing sprites and polygons (making them roughly the same size as in split screen) and running the game at a higher speed.\r\n\r\nBefore and after the race the player is able to set up tyre hardness, wing angle and the transmission, and can be forced to quit if the player fails to make a pitstop to replace worn out tyres, or simply overheats the engine by rapid downshifting at high speed, (over-revving is possible with automatic gears by knocking on other cars tyres, making the player car jump, causing a drastic increase in the RPM) noticeable by a loud squealing noise. On the Silverstone track there appears to be two 'retired' cars, one by the pits and one halfway round.","Genres":{"genre":"Racing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Domark","Developer":"Lankhor","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/37361-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"426","height":"600","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/37361-1.jpg"}}}},"Majors Pro Baseball, The":{"id":"14105","GameTitle":"The Majors Pro Baseball","PlatformId":"20","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1992","Overview":"The Majors: Pro Baseball is a Sports game, developed and published by Sega, which was released in 1992.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sega","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/14105-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"425","height":"600","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/14105-1.jpg"}}}},"Mappy":{"id":"27390","GameTitle":"Mappy","PlatformId":"20","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ReleaseDate":"05/24/1991","Overview":"Mappy (マッピー) is an arcade game developed by Namco which was ported to the Sega Game Gear in 1991.

Additionally, the game had an \"on fire\" feature, where if one player made three baskets in a row, he would become \"on fire\" and have unlimited turbo, no goaltending, and increased shooting ability, until the other team scored (or the player had scored four consecutive baskets while \"on fire\").","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Acclaim","Developer":"Midway","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"13","Game":[{"id":"36340","PlatformId":"4916"},{"id":"10966","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"8028","PlatformId":"14"},{"id":"12385","PlatformId":"15"},{"id":"38469","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"21601","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"3298","PlatformId":"9"},{"id":"5067","PlatformId":"21"},{"id":"657","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"39623","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"11035","PlatformId":"11"},{"id":"11986","PlatformId":"12"},{"id":"2815","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/11161-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/11161-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/11161-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"640","height":"887","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/11161-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/11161-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"916","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/11161-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/11161.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"156"}}}},"NBA Jam Tournament Edition":{"id":"11032","GameTitle":"NBA Jam Tournament Edition","PlatformId":"20","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1995","Overview":"NBA JAM Tournament Edition brings you more senses-shattering slam dunking excitement than ever!

It was released in 1994 for MS-DOS, Macintosh, Super NES and Game Boy. It was released shortly after Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures, which brought about the change from the classic arcade versions of Pac-Man to the development of more complex and adventurous games.\r\n\r\nThis game was an offshoot from the normal variety of Pac-Man games, in that it does not confine Pac-Man to a maze-like board. Rather, the player controls Pac-Man through various side-scrolling levels, obtaining many different items along the way; the plot does take elements from the earlier Pac-Man games, such as the objective to collect a certain number of pellets before exiting a level. The game allows the player to access completed levels via passwords that are given every five levels.\r\n\r\nThe game is a rebranded version of a 1993 game, Fury of the Furries, also developed by Kalisto. The PC, Macintosh and Game Boy versions are almost identical to the original, while the Super NES game, despite using the same basic gameplay mechanics, is an entirely new game using a different game engine and aesthetic.\r\n\r\nVersions of Pac-In-Time were planned for the Genesis and Game Gear were planned, but canceled. A ROM image of the Game Gear version has since surfaced online.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Namco","Developer":"Kalisto","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"21689","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"5773","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/37041-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"160","height":"144","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/37041-1.png"}}}},"Pac-Man":{"id":"25150","GameTitle":"Pac-Man","PlatformId":"20","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1991","Overview":"Gobble, gobble, gulp!

The series started on the Mega Drive and made its way to various other systems over the years. The game's title is based on the slang term for the severe friction burns that can occur in a motorcycle fall where skin comes into contact with the ground at high speed.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to improve on the basic Hang-On concept, where the player's vehicle remains on the same horizontal plane and turns are essentially a matter of moving left or right, Road Rash requires that players contend with various grade changes. The physics reflect the act of going up or down a hill, as well as turning while climbing; this results in the ability to launch one's motorcycle great distances, resulting in crashes (and their animations). Aside from this, Road Rash has a standard system of obstacles including street signs, trees, poles, and livestock; and taking from OutRun, active traffic while racing against other bikers.\r\n\r\nWhat Road Rash really brings to the table is \"brawling\"; the player can fight other bikers with a variety of hand weapons or simple punches and kicks. The player initially starts off with just those basics, but can grab a weapon from another rider by timing a punch correctly. The list of weapons has grown with the games, starting from the clubs in the first Road Rash, and eventually including things like crowbars, nunchaku, and cattle prods. Whatever the weapon, successful attacks damage an opponent's stamina, and depleting this stamina will cause a biker to wipeout which can also damage the bike; this functions much like hitting a car or other major obstacle, and it all applies to you as much as to other racers (though in most of the games, you have more stamina than opponents).\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the last and most major obstacle are cops. The motorcycle police officers fight the player as another opponent and serve as gameplay enforcers by culling players who fall too far behind or choose to explore the world rather than race in it. Losing a fight with an officer or being caught by one while off one's motorcycle causes the player to be Busted, ending the race.","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Racing"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","Developer":"Electronic Arts","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"9","Game":[{"id":"4855","PlatformId":"25"},{"id":"23340","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"21918","PlatformId":"41"},{"id":"5087","PlatformId":"21"},{"id":"4598","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"2557","PlatformId":"35"},{"id":"26290","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"9205","PlatformId":"17"},{"id":"11804","PlatformId":"10"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/19992-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"394","height":"541","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/19992-1.png"}}}},"Robocop 3":{"id":"25196","GameTitle":"Robocop 3","PlatformId":"20","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1995","Overview":"Old Detroit.

The game was noted for its good graphics and for being faithful to Spirou et Fantasio the comic book series, but due to the relatively high difficulty, most reviewers only recommended the game for true fans of the comic book series.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Platform"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Infogrames","Developer":"Infogrames","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"24123","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"19527","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"29172","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"6130","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/37044-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"305","height":"360","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/37044-1.jpg"}}}},"Sports Illustrated Championship Football & Baseball":{"id":"25220","GameTitle":"Sports Illustrated: Championship Football & Baseball","PlatformId":"20","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1993","Overview":"Sports Illustrated: Championship Football & Baseball is a Sports game, developed by Unexpected Development and published by Black Pearl, which was released in 1993.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Black Pearl","Developer":"Unexpected Development","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"21594","PlatformId":"4"}},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/25220-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"181","height":"250","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/25220-1.png"}}}},"Sports Trivia":{},"Sports Trivia - Championship Edition":{},"Star Trek Generations - Beyond the Nexus":{"id":"25222","GameTitle":"Star Trek: Generations: Beyond the Nexus","PlatformId":"20","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1995","Overview":"Star Trek: Generations: Beyond the Nexus is a Simulation game, developed and published by Absolute Entertainment, which was released in 1995.","Genres":{"genre":"Flight Simulator"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Absolute Entertainment","Developer":"Absolute Entertainment","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/25222-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"245","height":"342","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/25222-1.jpg"}}}},"Star Trek TNG - Advanced Holodeck Tutorial":{},"Star Wars":{"id":"5757","GameTitle":"Star Wars","PlatformId":"20","Platform":"Sega Game Gear","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1993","Overview":"Your mission: Rescue Princess Leia from Darth Vader's EVIL clutches!

However, Dino Dini, who had no involvement in Kick Off 3 would go on to form his own company and produce the Amiga/IBM PC game Goal!, which shares similar gameplay.
