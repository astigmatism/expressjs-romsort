While testing a piece of equipment, you are transported into a bubble world. Fortunately, a friendly denizen decides to help you. You must locate the correct type of radioactive particles to move from world to world and finally home, before the hostile denizens of these worlds burst your bubble.\r\n\r\nYou move your bubble by pushing in the desired direction. Be advised that you do not stop easily and can bounce out of control if you are not careful. Pushing the A button fires a bubble shot that will ricochet around. You can use this action to bounce shots at enemies that are around a corner. Pressing B drops a bubble bomb straight down. Pressing Option 1 switches options on the screen, including the suicidal \"Burst!!!\", that are then activated by pressing Option 2. The one you will use most is \"Use scanner\".

At the start of each level, the playing field is a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix — a sticklike entity that performs graceful but unpredictable motions within the confines of the rectangle.\r\n\r\nThe player controls a Stix that can move around the edges of the rectangle. Holding down one of the draw buttons allows the marker to move into unclaimed territory in an attempt to create a closed shape. If completed, the captured area (defined as the side opposite of where the Qix is) becomes filled in with a solid color and points are awarded. To complete a level, the player must claim 75% of the playfield (adjustable by the arcade operator to be between 50% and 90%).\r\n\r\nThe player's marker can move at two different speeds; areas drawn exclusively at the slower speed (orange-red on the screenshot shown) are worth double points. It cannot cross or backtrack along a line in progress.\r\n\r\nA life is lost if the Qix touches a line as it is being drawn or if the marker is touched by any of the Sparx – enemies that traverse all playfield edges except uncompleted lines. In addition, if the marker stops while drawing a line, a fuse will appear and burn along the uncompleted line toward the marker; if it reaches the marker, the player loses one life. The fuse disappears once the player moves the marker again.

It was designed by Akira Sakuma and features elements of tongue-in-cheek humor combined with the action. The player takes control of an enchanted ape who must battle hordes of jungle monsters with energy balls from his mouth. The ultimate goal is to destroy the evil wizard who cast a spell on the title protagonist; thereby transforming him from an ape back into a human, and rescuing the kidnapped princess. The game was ported to several video game consoles and home computers.\r\n\r\nDue to its popularity, within the next two years the game was ported to a larger number of home video game consoles and home computers of the time. Ocean Software published versions for the Amiga and Atari ST versions, They also advertised versions for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC and the Spectrum version was previewed in issue 90 of Crash Magazine, but neither port materialized. Taito published ports for the Atari Lynx and the Nintendo Entertainment System. The latter version of the game was slightly altered and featured a health bar so that Toki didn't die after one hit.\r\n\r\nSega would later reprogram and retool the game into an exclusive version for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis known as Toki: Going Ape Spit. This version lacks the non-spit power-ups, but it features additional levels and more detailed graphics.\r\n\r\nA new, independent enhanced remake was announced in October 2009. It is being developed by Golgoth Studio and targeted for release on PC via Steam and on home consoles through XBLA, PlayStation Network, and WiiWare. It was originally planned for a 2011 release, but it's still unreleased as of 2015, even if it was approved on Steam Greenlight at the end of 2013.","Co-op":"No","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"8592","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"2143","PlatformId":"7"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/27046-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"2628","height":"3256","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/27046-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/27046-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"2613","height":"3252","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27046-1.jpg"}}]}},"Tokumaru Raycaster 00 (PD)":{},"Tokumaru Raycaster 01 (PD)":{},"Tommy T's Play Me Sound Editor (PD)":{},"Tori PCM-Anime Demo by NES Hack Factory (PD)":{},"Tournament Cyberball 2072 ":{"id":"27047","GameTitle":"Tournament Cyberball","PlatformId":"4924","Platform":"Atari Lynx","Overview":"Robotic football action!\r\n\r\nJourney into the future of football with this cult, arcade classic.

At the start of each level, the playing field is a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix — a sticklike entity that performs graceful but unpredictable motions within the confines of the rectangle.\r\n\r\nThe player controls a Stix that can move around the edges of the rectangle. Holding down one of the draw buttons allows the marker to move into unclaimed territory in an attempt to create a closed shape. If completed, the captured area (defined as the side opposite of where the Qix is) becomes filled in with a solid color and points are awarded. To complete a level, the player must claim 75% of the playfield (adjustable by the arcade operator to be between 50% and 90%).\r\n\r\nThe player's marker can move at two different speeds; areas drawn exclusively at the slower speed (orange-red on the screenshot shown) are worth double points. It cannot cross or backtrack along a line in progress.\r\n\r\nA life is lost if the Qix touches a line as it is being drawn or if the marker is touched by any of the Sparx – enemies that traverse all playfield edges except uncompleted lines. In addition, if the marker stops while drawing a line, a fuse will appear and burn along the uncompleted line toward the marker; if it reaches the marker, the player loses one life. The fuse disappears once the player moves the marker again. The player has no defenses against the enemies and must out-maneuver them in order to survive.\r\n\r\nA meter at the top of the screen counts down to the release of additional Sparx, and the mutation of all Sparx into Super Sparx which can chase the player up an uncompleted line.\r\n\r\nAfter the player completes two levels, the difficulty increases by the inclusion of multiple Qixes, additional Sparx, speed increases, and the eventual appearance of only Super Sparx. In levels with multiple Qixes, the player can also complete the level by splitting the playfield into two regions, each containing at least one Qix.","Co-op":"No","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"25015","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"5197","PlatformId":"26"},{"id":"2022","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"21707","PlatformId":"4"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/27052-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"600","height":"735","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/27052-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/27052-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"600","height":"742","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27052-1.jpg"}}]}},"Raiden":{"id":"31701","GameTitle":"Raiden","PlatformId":"4924","Platform":"Atari Lynx","ReleaseDate":"10/20/1997","Overview":"In the year 2090, Earth has suddenly become the target of deranged aliens known as the Cranassians.
