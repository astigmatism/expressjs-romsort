Humanity has been reduced to a few survivors inhabiting the orbital space station Omega. Over the course of the history, aliens visited the Earth every twenty-five years, \"harvesting\" humans as an organic material. Eventually, they launch an assault on the last remnants of the human race. But Adam Drake, a genetically engineered soldier, comes into possession of a time-traveling device. He uses it to travel to the time periods of human history when aliens performed their deadly attacks. The fate of humanity is in his hands.\r\n\r\nBody Harvest is an action and driving game with a mission-based structure. The protagonist travels to various locations and eras (e.g. Greece during World War II, Siberia in the 1990s, etc.) with the goal of stopping alien invasions.

There are five worlds and each one must be unlocked by finding five cards from the previous world excluding the first.  Each world is divided into five stages with each stage divided into four levels.  The general goal of each level is to collect a certain amount of gold to activate a portal that allows the player to continue.

While initially it may seem like there is a deficit of courses, in fact, the multi-terrain courses contain mini-courses within each one. For instance, at least three times in each course, you will have the choice to take two different road directions -- either rough dirt track or snow-laden road, ot a slick but usually longer street course.

On most boards, players earn stars by reaching a star space and purchasing a star for a certain amount of coins. The star space appears randomly on one of several pre-determined locations and moves every time a star is purchased, usually occupying a blue space.\r\nEvery Mario Party contains at least 50 to almost 110 minigames with a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which players compete individually. In 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames, players compete as two groups, cooperating to win, even though they are still competing individually in the main game.

The Brotherhood tried to develop an elixir that would endow them with superhuman powers. However, rather than creating their intended superhumans, their experiments created only grotesque monsters. When they decided to use these creatures as an army of conquest, one of their number, Samuel Pepys, set their headquarters on fire, resulting in the First Great Fire of London. The game takes place in 1834 when London falls victim to several evil occurrences. Monster sightings are reported along with news of people mutating into ungodly creatures, and that the dead are waking from their graves and walking amongst the living. All of London is in a panic and vulnerable to the schemes of Adam Crowley, a mad scientist and occultist enlisting the help of the Brotherhood.","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Adventure"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTDbScc-kYs","Publisher":"Activision","Developer":"Kalisto","Rating":"8","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"12273","PlatformId":"10"}},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1173-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"2100","height":"1532","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1173-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1173-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"2100","height":"1532","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1173-1.jpg"}}],"banner":{"_":"graphical/1173-g.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1173-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1364","height":"768"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1173-1.jpg"},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/1173.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"218"}}}},"Nintama Rantarou 64 Game Gallery":{},"Nintendo Family by CALi (PD)":{},"Nintendo On My Mind Demo by Kid Stardust (PD)":{},"Nintendo WideBoy 64 by SonCrap (PD)":{},"Nintro64 Demo by Lem (POM '98) (PD)":{},"NuFan Demo by Kid Stardust (PD)":{},"Nuclear Strike 64":{"id":"1174","GameTitle":"Nuclear Strike 64","PlatformId":"3","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ReleaseDate":"12/02/1999","Overview":"Nuclear Strike 64 is a helicopter-based game, with strategy elements added to the action gameplay.

After receiving and hatching an egg, the player walks around the world, completing requests from people and raising monsters. Requests are basic RPG quests—such as collecting an item for a non-playable character—and the monsters fight in Pokémon-style, turn-based battles. Unlike Pokémon, every monster in the game comes from the one baby that the player receives as their first monster. Depending on the food it is fed, the monster gains element points, which determine how it evolves. Monsters level up both through defeating other monsters and when walking around the town. Monsters hatch from eggs that can be bought at the local monster shop.","Genres":{"genre":"Strategy"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9QH6JsO_hc","Publisher":"Bottom Up","Developer":"Bottom Up","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/31699-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"250","height":"339","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/31699-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/31699-1.jpg","$":{"width":"320","height":"220"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/31699-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/31699-2.jpg","$":{"width":"259","height":"194"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/31699-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/31699-3.jpg","$":{"width":"259","height":"194"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/31699-3.jpg"}]}},"PC-Engine 64 (POM '99) (PD)":{},"PD Ultraman Battle Collection 64":{},"PGA European Tour":{"id":"1180","GameTitle":"PGA European Tour","AlternateTitles":{"title":"PGA European Tour Golf"},"PlatformId":"3","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ReleaseDate":"06/15/2000","Overview":"Be sure to press your plaid slacks, because you're invited to rub elbows with some international swingers in the first-ever game to feature the PGA European license.\r\n\r\nPGA European tour is a hard-core golf sim featuring four authentic European courses.

However, if you beat the competition and place in the top three, your reward is the chance to upgrade your car. Be merciless and steal the losing racers' special features, such as engine and armor upgrades, special attack abilities, and enhancing cosmetic features for the car. You have 13 different racer body styles and nine tracks to choose from. The cartoony racers zip through city streets, ice caves, and a volcano, and with the Track Create mode, you can design the wildest track you can imagine.

The game, endorsed by Kevin Keegan, lets you take over the manager's reins of a soccer club in any of the English Leagues, be it the Premier League or the low lights of the Third Division. But this is no ordinary football game. Unlike others on the N64, PM is a management simulation, and you never actually take control of a match by controlling individual players. Instead, you pick the lineup, your own formation and the tactics of how the team should play. Then you let your players go off and do the work on their own. This makes the whole game harder since you never have direct control over the actions of the players -- instead, you have to hope that you picked the right combination of players and the right tactics to do the job.

It is the fourth game in the Puyo Puyo series and the last set during the Madou-era in the main series.\r\nContinuing the trend of naming the games after puns, the name comes from a pun on \"yon\", the Japanese word for the number 4, but this time this is the only reference to the pun.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay in is similar to that of Puyo Puyo 2, but adds super attacks. Clearing chains now builds up a \"charge meter\" which allows players to use them. The only other addition was a new game mode which could be played with a number of different field sizes, smaller or bigger than the standard 6x12, however, it removes several game modes that were present in Puyo Puyo Sun, i.e. the tournament, task and chain training modes. The art is also vastly different to the previous game in the series and, of course, the Fever series; this style was only otherwise used for Minna de Puyo Puyo.\r\n\r\nSTORY: \r\nSatan has released an odd demon called Pierott. Pierott invites Arle and Carbuncle over to the “Puyo Puyo Circus”. All seemed to be just fine, Arle and Carbuncle went into a tent to watch a magic show, but Satan had Carbuncle volunteer for a magic trick he was doing. A magic trick? Or a trap? He puts Carbuncle on the stand, and casts a spell, which makes Carbuncle, disappear! Arle wasn't worried, she didn't even know what was going on, but later on, she couldn't find Carbuncle anywhere! She then has to start battling monsters and oddball characters in a match of Puyo Puyo to try to reach Satan, and get Carbuncle back!\r\n\r\nThis version of the game have different music and lacks the voiced cutscenes due to cartridge's memory limitations, but can be played in 4-player mode like the Dreamcast version and included a Transfer Pack mode where one could unlock more artwork by plugging in Pocket Puyo Puyo Sun.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"4+","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Compile","Developer":"Compile","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/27817-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"337","height":"463","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/27817-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/27817-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"337","height":"462","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27817-1.jpg"}}]}},"Puyo Puyo Sun 64":{"id":"23759","GameTitle":"Puyo Puyo Sun 64","PlatformId":"3","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ReleaseDate":"10/31/1997","Overview":"Puyo Puyo SUN (ぷよぷよSUN Puyopuyo San?) is the third installment of the Puyo Puyo games series, and the sequel to Puyo Puyo Tsu, made in 1996 by Compile.

The success of the Dreamcast version led to it becoming one of the few Sega All Stars titles.\r\n\r\nLike Nintendo's Punch-Out!! series it features many characters with colorful personalities (i.e. Afro Thunder, Boris \"The Bear\" Knokimov, etc.); however, unlike the Punch-Out!! series, Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is in 3D, thus allowing for more control over your character in the ring, and also enables the players to choose whichever fighters they want.\r\n\r\nThroughout the fights in the game, there is a special RUMBLE meter which fills up, one letter at a time, until the word \"RUMBLE\" is spelled at the bottom of the screen. Letters can be obtained by successfully landing hard blows or taunting the opponent. Once the meter is full, the player can power himself up, enabling access to a special move called \"Rumble Flurry\", which might as well instantly knock the opposite player out cold.\r\n\r\nOne unique graphic feature of the game is the gradual bruises gained by players as the fight progresses (like hematomas and swellings), present in all fifth-generation versions. While this is not necessarily a new feature to games (it had been implemented before in SNK's 1992 game Art of Fighting), it garnered much appraisal from reviewers, because of the added fun factor this element supply to the game","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":{"genre":["Fighting","Sports"]},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Midway","Developer":"Midway","Rating":"7","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"22062","PlatformId":"41"},{"id":"11102","PlatformId":"16"},{"id":"9860","PlatformId":"10"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/396-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1000","height":"688","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/396-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/396-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1000","height":"684","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/396-1.jpg"}}]}},"Ready 2 Rumble Boxing - Round 2":{"id":"1190","GameTitle":"Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2","PlatformId":"3","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ReleaseDate":"10/23/2000","Overview":"Gameplay in the game is similar to that of the previous game.

To that end, Rocket employs an advanced physics engine which allows the main character, a lovable unicycle-based robot named Rocket, to travel and experiment with colorful, platform-esque worlds with realistic gravity and inertia.

The debate escalates to the point where they decide to hold a snowboarding tournament to determine who is the best. One character, Shinobin, has no involvement whatsoever until he is unlocked by the player.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the usual gameplay of a snowboarding game, Snowboard Kids adds \"Shots\" (special weapons used to attack players) and items which can help the player, hinder other players, or both.\r\n\r\nThe game has nine main courses. Although some of the courses are snowy mountains, many are courses that would be unorthodox for snowboarding in the real world. Such courses include an amusement park, a desert, a vast valley, a dark highway, and a Japanese village during the cherry blossom festival.\r\n\r\nThere were several game mechanics that were unique to Snowboard Kids from other snowboard games and racing games at the time. One was the addition of the second item slot, allowing each player to carry a shooting item and support item (such as a rock, or invisibility) at the same time. Also, players needed to pay 100 gold in order to grab an item during the race, which could be obtained either through performing tricks or collecting coins scattered across the course. All courses also required players to race down the hill for multiple laps. Once a player had reached the bottom of the hill, he or she would need to pass through the lift gate to be transported back to the top of the hill, and could not be attacked by other players in this transition.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Racing"},"Players":"4+","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Atlus","Developer":"Racdym","Rating":"6","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1202-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"2100","height":"1532","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1202-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1202-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"2100","height":"1532","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1202-1.jpg"}}],"banner":{"_":"graphical/1202-g.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1202-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1024","height":"768"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1202-1.jpg"}}},"Snowboard Kids 2":{"id":"1203","GameTitle":"Snowboard Kids 2","PlatformId":"3","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ReleaseDate":"03/02/1999","Overview":"The game is set in Snow Town, which is the main hometown of the protagonists. The plot follows the daily lives and adventures of the kids, and the rather ridiculous attempts of Damien to sabotage them.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay of this game is almost identical to its predecessor's, but with a few differences.\r\n\r\nThere are now three distinct playing modes: the Story mode, which follows the game plot and uses the classical system of cash prizes by winning the races; the battle mode, which includes multiplayer mode; and the Training mode.\r\n\r\nThere were new additions and changes to the Items and Shots. All of them were redesigned and the Shots were renamed as Weapons. Additions include the Rocket, the Wings and the Whirlwind (see more below).

The N64 version of the game is a port of the PC version with noticeable differences, such as a substantially different opening due to the lack of processing power needed to render cutscenes, and different music in certain places.

The game's protagonist is a girl Gijin (robot), named Josette, invented by the same Doctor Geppetto who built Pino 15 years prior. Having just completed Josette, the aged Doctor Geppetto had little time left to raise her on his own, so the player assists. The previous game's antagonist, Messala, receives orders from the Siliconian King, Siliconian XIII, to \"find the girl who lives on the island of Corlo who is in possession of the J,\" an object of great power capable of giving Gijin humanity and making highly desired dreams come true. Siliconian armies are dispatched to find the girl at Corlo Island. Geppetto tells Josette to leave the island for the island of Blueland where she will meet someone to help her. Blueland is occupied by the Siliconian Army, which is harvesting Proton, a mineral fuel source.\r\n\r\n     The player communicates with Josette through her robot, Bird. The player answers her questions on-screen by selecting \"yes\" or \"no\". Josette cannot hear or see the player, but learns about the player through successive, binary questions. She recalls the answers later throughout the story. The player can command Josette through Bird, though she does not always listen. Player advancement through the game is dependent on how well their teachings mesh with other activities on the island. After teaching Josette a series of fundamental human interactions, the game's plot-driven second chapter guides Josette through a series of hardships and confrontation with the Siliconian Army.","Genres":{"genre":["Adventure","Life Simulation"]},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Enix","Developer":"Givro","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/36109-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"911","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/36109-1.jpg"}}}},"World Cup 98":{"id":"1239","GameTitle":"World Cup 98","AlternateTitles":{"title":["Copa del Mundo: Francia 98","Coupe du Monde 98","Frankreich 98: Die Fussball-WM"]},"PlatformId":"3","Platform":"Nintendo 64","ReleaseDate":"05/18/1998","Overview":"The main feature of the game is the World Cup tournament itself, where the player may use either the actual groups used in the finals, or groups composed of a random selection of the included teams.
