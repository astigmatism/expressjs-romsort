It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America, Australia, Europe, and other regions. It was originally released in three different versions: Dachshund & Friends, Lab & Friends (Shiba & Friends in Japan), and Chihuahua & Friends. It has been re-released twice since then, first as a bundled release with a special edition Nintendo DS with a new version called Nintendogs: Best Friends, and then later as Nintendogs: Dalmatian & Friends.\r\n\r\nNintendogs uses the DS's touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player's dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well as to teach the dog tricks such as \"sit\" or \"roll over\". Players can bring their dogs on walks and to the park if they so choose. They may interact with other players in multi-player by using the DS's wireless linkup. It also uses the DS's internal clock and calendar to allow the dog to grow hungrier or dirtier based on the elapsed time.\r\n\r\nNintendogs received critical acclaim. It has an aggregate score of 85% at Game Rankings,[3] and has won many awards, including the 2006 Innovation Award from PC World and Best Handheld Game from the Associated Press. As of March 31, 2015, all versions of Nintendogs combined have sold 23.96 million copies worldwide, making it second on the Nintendo DS best-sellers list, behind only New Super Mario Bros.[4] Because of Nintendogs' success, Nintendo has made several related products, including Nintendogs toys[5] and a series of Nintendogs trading cards.[6] At E3 2010, it was announced a sequel, titled Nintendogs + Cats, would be released for the Nintendo 3DS.","Co-op":"No","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/13828-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"480","height":"435","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/13828-1.jpg"}}}},"Pac-Pix":{"id":"27290","GameTitle":"Pac-Pix","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"04/26/2005","Overview":"A mischievous magician, known for playing pranks on poor unsuspecting folks, created something known as \"Ghost Ink,\" a fluid that pretty much turns any drawing into evil and vicious ghost monsters.

His or her latest dream, shown in the opening cinematic, features a mysterious voice which reveals not only that the protagonist's world has undergone countless reincarnations in the past and is fated to continue the cycle of correction, destruction, and rebirth until “true enlightenment” is achieved, but also that the main character him- or herself has been tasked by the Powers-That-Be to deem the people, places, and things of the current world worthy (or unworthy) of being carried over into the next after the fiery purge.","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Xseed Games","Developer":"Matrix Software","Rating":"7","Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/6576-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/6576-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/6576-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/6576-2.jpg"}],"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/6576-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1539","height":"1370","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/6576-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/6576-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1532","height":"1370","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/6576-1.jpg"}}]}},"Avatar - Der Herr der Elemente - Die Erde Brennt":{},"Avatar - The Last Airbender":{"id":"8549","GameTitle":"Avatar: The Last Airbender","AlternateTitles":{"title":"Avatar: The Legend of Aang"},"PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"10/10/2006","Overview":"Avatar: The Last Airbender (known as Avatar: The Legend of Aang in Europe) is a video game based on the animated television series of the same name for Game Boy Advance, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Wii, and Xbox.

Players must destroy enemies, solve puzzles in order to progress further, and throughout the game, maximize their individual special powers and gain better and deadlier weapons.\r\n\r\nWhile the game is loosely based on the first part of the Bionicle Legends story arc; it is non-canonical and features several characters from previous arcs in the franchise.\r\n\r\nThe Nintendo DS version of Bionicle Heroes is in the first-person perspective instead of third-person, and is the first LEGO game to be rated T for Teen. The Game Boy Advance version is also vastly different, having a top-down perspective instead of over the character's shoulder.","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Shooter"]},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Eidos Interactive","Developer":"TT Games and Amaze Entertainment","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"5","Game":[{"id":"24210","PlatformId":"15"},{"id":"24209","PlatformId":"5"},{"id":"6943","PlatformId":"2"},{"id":"8077","PlatformId":"9"},{"id":"8078","PlatformId":"11"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/20673-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"445","height":"445","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/20673-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/20673-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"900","height":"811","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/20673-1.jpg"}}]}},"Bisanggu - Exit DS":{},"Biz Nouryoku DS Series - Miryoku Kaikaku":{},"Biz Nouryoku DS Series - Wagokoro no Moto":{},"Biz Taiken DS Series - Kigyoudou Inshoku":{},"Black Cat - Kuroneko no Concerto":{},"Black Jack - Hi no Tori Hen":{},"Black Sigil - Blade of the Exiled":{"id":"11208","GameTitle":"Black Sigil: Blade of the Exiled","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"06/08/2009","Overview":"Bel Lenora is a world where people are born with magic at their command.

Touchdowns are scored by taking the ball into the opposition's end zone, and a team can win either by scoring the most touchdowns, or by violently eliminating the other team's entire roster.[1] The game has both real-time and turn-based strategy modes.[2] Players may choose to play the game in either mode.[1] The Special Play cards are not included in the main game.[3]\r\n\r\nDuring the main career mode, the player must start from scratch and build a team; the career mode can go on ad infinitum.[3] As the team goes up in ranking on the tournament ladder, a player will sign better players for their roster.[1] If one or several of the roster players are injured or killed during a match, the player needs to replace them for one or several of the next matches until they are ready to go back to the field. If the player lacks money to heal them, they will still be able to play the injured player, but the chances that player is killed increases.[1]\r\n\r\nRoster players take part in tournaments, where they gain experience and level up. The player can assign skill points to buy new abilities that will affect the player's performance, such as improving their dice rolls, have a second chance on a bad roll, and other bonuses along those lines.[1] Leagues are completely customizable: there are 25 elements can be edited by the user, such as teams, races, players, and championship rules. Players may also set up online tournaments with others in the online community, which also allows players to gain experience as with the single player mode.[1] Tournaments may have a minimum of four participants, and a maximum of 24; none of the teams may be AI-controlled.[3] A player may play with a solo franchise team online, but may not use it in online tournaments or leagues.[3] Players may not switch between RTS and turn-based modes mid-tournament.[3] Players may create custom logos for their teams.[3]\r\n\r\nThe Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable versions lack career league play and customization options. Multiplayer involves turn-based hotseat gameplay on the handheld versions, though the PSP version also includes wireless multiplayer.[1]\r\nThe first release on both DS and PSP showed significant functional issues that prevented players to complete career mode as their data files were corrupted after a few hours of game play. A replacement service has since been provided to owners of the PSP version.[4] The Xbox version also suffered issues, such as in-game players not keeping experience they gained during games, making league play useless.[5] The Xbox version was also dropped after the original version of the game.[","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Sports","Strategy"]},"Co-op":"No","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"15633","PlatformId":"15"},{"id":"181","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"18718","PlatformId":"13"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/24366-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"571","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/24366-1.jpg"}}}},"Blood Stone 007":{},"Blood of Bahamut":{"id":"5475","GameTitle":"Blood of Bahamut","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"08/06/2009","Overview":"There are various gigantic opponents you face off with in this game, some of them are shaped like humans and the others are monsters.

But once the fight begins, everything starts happening in real time and you must feverishly put together your plan of attack, because those enemies aren't waiting for your turn. You command your units around the field with quick but simple controls that rely totally on the touch screen. You tell your units where to go, who to fight, when to heal, and when to move to special areas on the map. It seems like your attention is constantly needed everywhere at once, but the game gives you some room for error by providing a high number of healing items. Also, as you progress through each map, the game occasionally pauses to let some part of the story play out. The game will feature a thirty-hour quest as well as the ability to control up to sixteen humans and Mecha Robos in real-time battles and shadow fights.","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":{"genre":["Role-Playing","Strategy"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Feel Plus","Developer":"Ignition Entertainment","Rating":"7.5","Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/11212-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/11212-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/11212-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/11212-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/11212-3.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/11212-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/11212-4.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/11212-4.jpg"}],"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/11212-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"640","height":"566","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/11212-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/11212-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"559","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/11212-1.jpg"}}]}},"Boarding School - Black Lagoon, The":{},"Bob Esponja - Atrapados en el Congelador":{},"Bob the Builder - Festival of Fun":{},"Bob the Builder Festival of Fun":{},"Boing!

This prototype was rejected by publishers, but after coming up with the premise of Chocolatier the team was signed-up by PlayFirst and completed the title. The game received a mostly positive reception: reviewers enjoyed the action mini-game which is played when chocolates are manufactured, and the game's graphics, sound, and Victorian-era presentation.","Co-op":"No","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"41706","PlatformId":"1"}},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/14244-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"500","height":"500","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/14244-1.jpg"}}}},"Chokkan!

In the game, the player creates their own playable characters, level objects, and accessories by drawing them using the DS's stylus and Touch Screen. The game was ported to iOS by WayForward Technologies and released by 505 Games on May 22, 2014.[2]\r\n\r\nDrawn to Life requires the player to create a hero in order to free a cursed village from an encroaching darkness. It features numerous platforming levels, a top down central village, and other elements such as vehicles, weapons, and platforms, which are drawn or colored by the player using the stylus.\r\n\r\nTwo sequels have come out, both under the title Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter, for release on the Wii and DS.[5] A spin-off title, Drawn to Life: SpongeBob SquarePants Edition (based on the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \"Frankendoodle\"), was developed by Altron for the DS.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Co-op":"No","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/17231-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"385","height":"346","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/17231-1.jpg"}}}},"Drawn to Life - Kamisama no Marionette":{},"Drawn to Life - SpongeBob Edition":{},"Drawn to Life - SpongeBob SquarePants Edition":{"id":"15211","GameTitle":"Drawn To Life: Spongebob Squarepants","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"09/15/2008","Overview":"Drawn to Life: SpongeBob SquarePants Edition is a video game for the Nintendo DS.[2] It is a spin-off of 5th Cell's 2007 DS hit Drawn to Life, and is based on the Nickelodeon animated comedy series SpongeBob SquarePants, specifically the episode \"Frankendoodle\".

One of the games was developed by 5th Cell for the Nintendo DS, while the other was created by Planet Moon Studios for the Wii.[1][\r\n\r\n\r\nThe game begins with a surreal sequence, wherein an unknown party asks the player “What do you remember about that day?” The player is given several dialogue choices that build a cohesive description of \"that day\", though at this time, the player is not aware of the event's importance (or even occurrence). Before the game properly begins, the player is asked to draw an image depicting this mysterious scene, introducing them to the game's core \"draw\" functionality.\r\n\r\nFollowing this is an animation sequence wherein one of the characters from the previous game, Heather, recovers from a nightmare. She is shown to possess a red-colored jewel pendant. In the same sequence, Heather is abducted by a darkness which emanated from a scepter she discovered in a beached treasure chest in the middle of the night. The next morning, when the other characters realize she's missing, a search for her is dramatically cut short by Wilfre, who causes the majority of the Raposa villagers to vanish, reveals himself as Heather's captor, and ultimately drains the Village of color. The remaining characters flee to the back of a massive turtle delivered, upon request, by the Creator.\r\n\r\nTheir numbers sorely reduced and their home ruined, the game follows the Raposa's struggle to reunite with their fellows and, with the aid of the Creator's Hero of Creation, defeat Wilfre before he can realize his as-yet unknown goals. The remaining members of the Village travel to Watersong, Lavasteam, the Galactic Jungle, and Wilfre's Wasteland, a combination of all three villages. At Watersong, Mari and Jowee meet Sock, who is an important character later in the story.","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38vo6KgTa3k","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"18912","PlatformId":"9"}},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27336-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"573","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27336-1.jpg"}}}},"Drawn to Life - The Next Chapter v1.1":{},"Drawn to Life Collection":{"id":"41529","GameTitle":"Drawn to Life Collection","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"11/23/2010","Overview":"Your Hero.

The hamster will then appear in a cage and be ready to play. Various actions can be chosen including training, feeding, care and other options. Training consists of teaching the hamster words (which they repeat back in their own hamster speak) by speaking the set phrases into the DS microphone. The hamster can repeat these phrases back, but inaudibly. Players can clean the cage and brush their hamsters. Hamsterz Life also includes many mini-games to play. Players can only have one hamster at home at once, any other hamsters that are owned are left with a girl with hamster ears until you wish to switch. Your hamsters can visit with the hamsters of friends who also own Hamsterz Life. When playing mini-games, if you win you receive prizes such as food or toys.

As with previous installments of the PC series IL-2 Sturmovik, it depicts combat aircraft from World War II, although with less focus on realistic simulation than other entries in the series.[2] The game has a campaign mode in which players are able to fly the Allies against the Axis, and also a multiplayer mode in which they are able to select either faction.[3] A demo of the game launched on the PSN and Xbox 360's Xbox Live on 29 July 2009.[4]\r\n\r\nBirds of Prey is based around the large-scale aerial combat and ground military operations of World War II. Players can participate in some of the war’s most famous battles, piloting fighters, attack aircraft and heavy bombers across a range of missions. There are six theatres of war to engage in: The Battle of Britain, Stalingrad, Berlin, Sicily, Korsun and the Battle of the Bulge, representing the main airborne battles of World War II in Europe.\r\n\r\nBirds of Prey has a new damage effects engine. Players can see real-time damage to the aircraft such as holes in the wings and trail lines during dog fights. IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey features hundreds of aircraft taking part in air battles. The environmental engine also produces high-detail, realistic landscapes that allow players to easily see ground support actions.[5]\r\n\r\nThe game was developed by Gaijin Entertainment, who subsequently developed Birds of Steel, also exclusively for consoles. Birds of Steel shares many traits with Birds of Prey (including HUD, aircraft models, controls, and menu design) but differentiates itself by concentrating primarily on US–Japanese aerial battles of the Pacific theater.","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Flight Simulator"]},"Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N9_C--zqZI","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"12704","PlatformId":"15"},{"id":"12705","PlatformId":"12"},{"id":"19371","PlatformId":"13"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/19222-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"555","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/19222-1.jpg"}}}},"Ice Age - Dawn of the Dinosaurs":{"id":"15671","GameTitle":"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"06/30/2009","Overview":"Based on the computer-animated movie starring the voices of Ray Romano and John Leguizamo, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a 3D platform game that has you controlling multiple prehistoric protagonists across more than 15 levels of lighthearted action.

A Championship race is one where the player collects mangoes and tries to finish first place in order to unlock higher speed classes (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, 200cc, the last one is raced in reverse direction/mirror mode), more karts and tracks. In Time Trial, players beat their own times and earn medals (gold, silver and bronze). In Checkpoint Race, players collect as many hourglasses as they can before the time runs out.

Players will enjoy the game while developing the powers of thinking, utilising their existing knowledge and experience. This game transforms basic curiosity into powerful thinking.\r\n\r\nMinDStorm, from developer ASK Co. Ltd., takes brain exercise software to a new level and offers a whole raft of exciting new games, features and challenges all designed specifically to stimulate and improve the player's brain functions and most importantly, be fun to play in their own right.\r\n\r\nTransform gaming curiosity into powerful thinking with MinDStorm. The game features ten distinct types of challenge for players, all of which are simple to pick up and play using the Nintendo DS stylus, touch screen and microphone. Each of MinDStorm's challenges is designed to focus on enhancing the player's reason, endurance, analysis, intuition or observation. Regardless of the type of game chosen, extended play results in improved overall brain function and enhanced memory.\r\n\r\nA first for the brain training genre, MinDStorm throws additional challenges and problems into the mix. Players are rewarded with ever more complex riddles to solve as they do well in the main training mode. General knowledge and geography-based challenges are also included to accompany the more abstract trials such as sliding picture puzzles, mazes to navigate with the stylus and spot the difference games.\r\n\r\nFurther innovation is found in the way the game will adapt the tasks it asks players to perform according to the local environment it is being played in. When playing on a bumpy car or train ride for instance, MinDStorm will omit the tasks that require precise stylus action. When playing in public the game will spare players the need to vocalize into the Nintendo DS microphone. With its many innovative and exciting challenges and features, MinDStorm offers arguably the most thorough workout yet seen in a brain training title.","ESRB":"EC - Early Childhood","Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/36174-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"500","height":"450","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/36174-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/36174-1.jpg","$":{"width":"600","height":"222"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/36174-1.jpg"}}},"Minagara Oreru DS Origami":{},"Mind Quiz - Your Brain Coach":{},"Mind Your Language - Apprends le Francais!":{},"Mind Your Language - Aprende Espanol!":{},"Mind Your Language - Learn English!":{"id":"30600","GameTitle":"Mind Your Language: Learn English","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"02/13/2009","Overview":"\"Mind Your Language\" makes learning fun and takes the chore out of studying.

It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America, Australia, Europe, and other regions. It was originally released in three different versions: Dachshund & Friends, Lab & Friends (Shiba & Friends in Japan), and Chihuahua & Friends. It has been re-released twice since then, first as a bundled release with a special edition Nintendo DS with a new version called Nintendogs: Best Friends, and then later as Nintendogs: Dalmatian & Friends.\r\n\r\nNintendogs uses the DS's touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy.

When the Prince arrives at Malik's kingdom, he finds it under attack by an army which is attempting to breach the treasure vaults for a great power known as \"Solomon's Army\". The Prince charges in to the city, and tracks Malik to the treasure vaults. Here, Malik says that he is fighting a losing battle and proposes to rely on a last resort or be forced to retreat. The Prince strongly objects, but Malik releases Solomon's Army using a magical seal. Solomon's Army is an assortment of different creatures, all made of sand. The Prince and Malik both manage to obtain halves of the seal used to keep the army contained, protecting them from being turned into sand statues, which is the fate of the rest of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nMalik is separated from the Prince, who finds a portal to the domain of Razia, a Djinn of the Marid race. Razia tells the Prince that the only way to re-imprison Solomon's Army is to reunite both halves of the seal. Razia gives the Prince special powers and sends him to find Malik, and the other half of the seal. When the Prince finds Malik, he is not interested in stopping Solomon's Army, but instead wants to destroy it and use its power to become a more powerful leader. This is explained by Razia: whereas the Prince is using the power gifted to him by Razia, Malik is using power taken directly from those he defeats. The Army's sand is gradually affecting his mind, making him susceptible to Ratash's influence. The Prince again sets out to find Malik, but this time to forcibly take his half of the seal. When he finds him, Malik is stronger and manages to escape. Pursuing Malik again, the Prince finds Ratash, Ifrit leader of the Army, searching for the seal. After the Prince outruns him, he concludes Ratash must now be chasing Malik, and so sets out to aid him. The Prince arrives in the throne room to find Malik and Ratash fighting, and he aids Malik. The Prince and Malik seem to kill Ratash, and Malik absorbs his power, shattering his half of the seal. Malik then runs off, seemingly in a hysterical fit, using some of Ratash's powers to escape.\r\n\r\nThe Prince pursues him, and again finds Razia. Razia explains that Ratash cannot be killed by any ordinary sword, and that what actually happened was quite different from what the Prince saw: Ratash has actually killed Malik, and possessed his body. The Prince doesn't believe this, and sets out to find the Djinn Sword, hidden in the ancient city of Rekem, which Razia says can kill Ratash. Along the way, the Prince chases Malik, now being used by Ratash to retake the Ifrit's original form. The Prince loses a battle to Ratash and, convinced his brother is truly dead, finds the Djinn Sword. Razia soon bonds with the sword, giving it the power needed to destroy Ratash. The Prince again searches for Ratash. When he finds him, Ratash is now gigantic, literally fed by the sandstorm which has come over the palace. The Prince uses the sword to kill Ratash, and, when the sandstorm subsides, he finds Malik dying. Malik says to tell their father that Prince will be as mighty a leader as Solomon, then dies. In an epilogue, the Prince tells of how he took the sword back to Rekem, where he thought Razia would want to rest, and how he must now set out to inform his father of Malik's death.","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Adventure","Puzzle","Strategy"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Ubisoft","Developer":"Casablanca","Rating":"6","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"5","Game":[{"id":"13258","PlatformId":"15"},{"id":"11753","PlatformId":"9"},{"id":"891","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"12381","PlatformId":"12"},{"id":"15972","PlatformId":"13"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/38947-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"239","height":"215","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/38947-1.jpg"}}}},"Princess Angel":{},"Princess Bakery":{},"Princess Ballerina - Yumemiru 4-Nin no Primadonna":{},"Princess Debut":{"id":"15122","GameTitle":"Princess Debut","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"09/30/2008","Overview":"Princess Debut (お姫さまデビュー) is a rhythm otome game published by Natsume and developed by Cave for the Nintendo DS.\r\n\r\nThe illustration and package design was done by Kotori Momoyuki, a manga artist serialized in Kodansha's Nakayoshi.","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Natsume","Developer":"Cave","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/15122-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"385","height":"353","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/15122-1.jpg"}}}},"Princess Debut - The Royal Ball":{},"Princess Isabella - A Witch's Curse":{},"Princess Isabella A Witchs Curse":{},"Princess Lillifee - Fairy Magic":{},"Princess Lillifee - My Dearest Friends":{},"Princess Lillifee - My Wonderful World":{},"Princess Lillifee My Wonderful World":{},"Princess Maker 4 - Special Edition":{},"Princess Maker 4 DS - Special Edition":{},"Princess Melody":{},"Princess Natasha - Student-Secret Agent-Princess":{},"Princess and the Frog, The":{},"Princess in Love":{},"Princess on Ice":{},"Prinses Lillifee":{},"Prinzessin Lillifee - Feenzauber":{},"Prinzessin Lillifee - Spielesammlung":{},"Prism - Light the Way":{"id":"15123","GameTitle":"Prism","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"10/16/2007","Co-op":"No","Rating":"8","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/15123-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"385","height":"345","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/15123-1.jpg"}}}},"Pro Evolution Soccer 2008":{"id":"16211","GameTitle":"Pro Evolution Soccer 2008","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"03/11/2008","Overview":"Pro Evolution Soccer 2008[1] (officially abbreviated as PES 2008 and known as World Soccer: Winning Eleven 2008 in Korea and Japan, sometimes called World Soccer: Winning Eleven 11 in PS2) is an association football video game in the Pro Evolution Soccer series by Konami.

There is a clandestine group, under the guise of scholarly research, plotting to resurrect a goddess whose time has long since passed. To achieve this goal, they need two things; a vessel of flesh and blood to house the spirit of the goddess, and the lives of every living being offered up as a sacrifice. It is against the backdrop of this coming chaos that Ares, an orphan from a small, forgotten village, sets out to seek his fortune as an adventurer. At the start of his journey, he encounters a beautiful young girl with mysterious powers named Shiera, who has not only lost her memories about herself, but also of the world around her. Together, they embark on an adventure that will ultimately decide the fate of the entire world.

The objective of the source material is to reach the top of each level, taking out any enemies in the way by firing magical rainbows that can trap or eliminate foes as well as providing bridges for the player to walk on. Rainbows remain onscreen for a short amount of time but can be ?broken? by the player if they jump on them. Once broken, the rainbow will fall off the screen, taking out the first enemy it touches. The game also features a pleasing bonus item system where dispatched enemies leave behind items of food that have varying point values and power-ups that have a range of helpful effects. The major feature of this re-interpretation is shifting the entire game away from traditional controls by implementing a global touchscreen control system which radically alters the way in which the game plays. The game is also displayed across both screens of the DS. Rather than being fired by a button press, rainbows are now drawn directly onto the gameplay area using the stylus and movement is executed by dragging the player?s character around the levels. The objective is still to reach the top of the level, but the time limit has been extended to account for the player being unable to move and use rainbows simultaneously. Rainbows are now broken by pressing the stylus onto them.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Platform"]},"Players":"4+","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Codemasters","Developer":"Marvelous Entertainment","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27834-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"480","height":"426","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27834-1.jpg"}}}},"Raku Raku Shindenzu Training DS":{},"Ram Racing":{},"Ratatouille":{"id":"31204","GameTitle":"Ratatouille","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"06/26/2007","Overview":"In Disney/Pixar's animated adventure, a rat named Remy dreams of becoming a great French chef despite his family's wishes and the obvious problem of being a rat in a decidedly rodent-phobic profession.

It was later ported for the Sega Saturn, Microsoft Windows and Nintendo DS platforms. Resident Evil was very well received critically and commercially, and has been credited with starting the modern survival horror genre. Its success spawned a multitude of sequels and spin-offs in the Resident Evil series.\r\n\r\nOriginally conceived as a remake of Capcom's earlier horror-themed game Sweet Home, development for the game was directed by Shinji Mikami, who took gameplay design cues from the 1992 game Alone in the Dark. Resident Evil establishes many conventions seen in later games of the series, such as the control scheme, the inventory system, as well as the iconic typewriter-based saving process.\r\n\r\nThe game introduces Resident Evil series mainstays Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine as members of an elite task force known as S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Service). At the start of the game, players select one of the two as they investigate the disappearance of their fellow team members on the outskirts of Raccoon City, and become trapped in an old mansion infested with zombies and other monsters. As players explore this mysterious place, they uncover clues and solve puzzles. Depending on the player's actions, the game ends with different outcomes.\r\n\r\nA remake, also called Resident Evil, was released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2002, featuring new graphics, music and voice acting, and many gameplay and plot changes. The events of the game were revisited in 2007's Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles. Its direct prequel, Resident Evil Zero, was released in 2002. A high definition version of the remake was released in January 2015 as Resident Evil HD Remaster.","ESRB":"M - Mature","Genres":{"genre":"Horror"},"Players":"4+","Co-op":"Yes","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHXNTkjg8HI","Publisher":"capcom","Developer":"capcom","Rating":"7","Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/3948-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/3948-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/3948-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/3948-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/3948-3.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/3948-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/3948-4.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/3948-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/3948-5.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/3948-5.jpg"}],"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/3948-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1545","height":"1370","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/3948-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/3948-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"450","height":"402","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/3948-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/3948.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"175"}}}},"Restaurant Tycoon":{},"Retro Arcade Toppers":{},"Retro Atari Classics":{"id":"6872","GameTitle":"Retro Atari Classics","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"03/14/2005","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Atari","Developer":"Taniko","Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/6872-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/6872-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/6872-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1530","height":"1370","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/6872-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/6872-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1532","height":"1370","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/6872-1.jpg"}}]}},"Retro Game Challenge":{"id":"6873","GameTitle":"Retro Game Challenge","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"02/10/2009","Overview":"Thrown back in time to the 1980's, you are turned into a young boy and forced to play video games by an evil self-proclaimed \"Game Master\", Game Master Arino.

As with similar titles, the game uses various controllers to simulate the performance of rock music, primarily using guitar and drum controllers on its Xbox 360 and PS3 versions.\r\n\r\nRock Revolution received generally negative reviews from critics, who felt that the game was merely an inferior clone of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises with no distinguishing characteristics to set it apart from its competition; particularly the design of its drum kit controller, the game's interface, and its soundtrack of mostly cover versions as its worst aspects. The game also experienced low sales numbers in its first month, selling only around 3,000 copies.","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":{"genre":"Music"},"Co-op":"No","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"13755","PlatformId":"15"},{"id":"16368","PlatformId":"9"},{"id":"16367","PlatformId":"12"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/16369-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1024","height":"912","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/16369-1.jpg"}}}},"RockMan EXE 5 DS - Twin Leaders":{},"RockMan ZX":{},"RockMan ZX Advent":{},"RockMan Zero Collection":{},"Rockin' Pretty":{},"Rockman EXE - Operate Shooting Star":{},"Rollin' Rascals":{},"Rondo of Swords":{"id":"14064","GameTitle":"Rondo of Swords","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"04/15/2008","Overview":"The King of Bretwalde is dead.

It was initially developed for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 consoles and on the iOS, second-generation N-Gage, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, and Java-equipped mobile phone handhelds.[2]\r\n\r\nThe game was released in North America on September 16, 2008, in Australia and Southeast Asia on September 17, and in Europe on September 19. LucasArts released downloadable content for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles.[3] An Ultimate Sith Edition of the game, containing new and all previously released expanded content, was released in November 2009,[4] which also came out on Mac OS and Microsoft Windows.\r\n\r\nThe project bridges the first two Star Wars trilogies, acting as an origin story for both the united Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Civil War depicted in the Original Trilogy. The game introduces a new protagonist, \"Starkiller\", as Darth Vader's secret apprentice, who is tasked with hunting down Jedi while killing rebels and Imperials alike in order to hide his existence from the Emperor, but soon starts to slowly redeem himself to the light side of the Force.\r\n\r\nReviews offered mixed response, praising The Force Unleashed for its compelling story, robust physics, impressive art and soundtrack, but also citing frustrating gameplay. Despite this, the game was a bestseller in the United States and Australia, with over one million copies sold its debut month. As of February 2010, the game has sold over seven million copies, and it is the fastest-selling Star Wars video game.[5] A sequel, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, was released in October 2010.[6]","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkBiYpD3SDc","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/24415-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"300","height":"269","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/24415-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/24415.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"300"}}}},"Star Wars - The Force Unleashed II":{"id":"25892","GameTitle":"Star Wars The Force Unleashed II","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","Overview":"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II is an action-adventure platform video game developed and published by LucasArts.

The clone embarks on a quest to find his identity and find Starkiller's love interest, Juno Eclipse. Production for The Force Unleashed II transpired over an approximate period of nine months; while it possesses some similarities to the previous game, producers modified several aspects such as the sound effects and gameplay. Sam Witwer again provides the voice and likeness for Starkiller, and several cast members return to voice and provide likeness to their respective roles.\r\n\r\nThe Force Unleashed II produced varying responses from critics, who despite adulating the sound design and aesthetics, were concerned with several gameplay elements and an underwhelming storyline. Aggregate scores range from the 40–70% range at websites GameRankings and Metacritic. During the first few weeks after its release it placed fifth or higher in sales for several regions.","Co-op":"No","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/25892-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"775","height":"695","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/25892-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/25892.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"300"}}}},"Star Wars Battlefront - Elite Squadron":{"id":"38950","GameTitle":"Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron","PlatformId":"8","Platform":"Nintendo DS","ReleaseDate":"11/03/2009","Overview":"Elite Squadron allows players to participate in combat on foot, in ground vehicles or in space.

Yoshi can increase his counter by collecting stars that are rewards for some puzzles and defeating certain enemies.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Platform"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Nintendo","Developer":"Artoon","Rating":"4.5","Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/6905-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/6905-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/6905-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/6905-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/6905-3.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/6905-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/6905-4.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/6905-4.jpg"}],"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/6905-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1536","height":"1370","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/6905-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/6905-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1535","height":"1370","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/6905-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/6905.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"89"}}}},"Yoshis Island DS":{},"Yosumin.
