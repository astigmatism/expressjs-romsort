The game was ported by Data East to the Family Computer in 1986, and was Data East's very first home release for this platform.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game consists of 45 levels (30 in the Family Computer version), and no background story or plot is given. The player controls a ship called the FX-1, and collects power-up parts (called a \\\"wing\\\") to progress through the levels and ultimately defeat the Gobunasu armored mobile fortress in the final level. The game consists of two different top-view screen levels, where the player can press the second button to descend to the ground whenever they do not have a power-up. The player is unaffected by attacks from airborne units while they are playing on the ground level, but the ship is automatically brought back into the air after a certain period of time. The player can still be hit by attacks from ground units while they are on the ground level, and can also lose their ship by crashing into obstacles. The 8-way joystick controls the player's movements, and one button is used for shooting, and the other is used for descending to the ground (or un-equipping wings). The background image continues infinitely when the player scrolls in the horizontal directions.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompleting the final level of the game causes the score counter to increase to 9,999,999 points, which the player can enter as their high score. The player can also score cheap points by equipping and un-equipping their power-up. Pressing the button twice while the un-equipping animation is occurring cause the player to gain 2,000 points. The player gains an extra life every 40,000 points, so it is possible to gain lives almost infinitely. If the player gains over 10,000,000 points in this way before completing the final level, the counter takes over 20 minutes to increase to 99,999,999 points.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Shooter\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Data East\",\"Developer\":\"Data East\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"1\",\"Game\":{\"id\":\"34438\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\"}},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/21127-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"414\",\"height\":\"280\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/21127-1.jpg\"}},\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/21127-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"256\",\"height\":\"240\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/21127-1.jpg\"}}}","B00DaW's Pokemon Demo (PD)":{},"BAPSACRSTRKCGTF (Demo Phase 1) (AKA B00daw's Folly) (PD)":{},"BAPSACRSTRKCGTF (Demo Phase 2) (AKA B00daw's Folly) (PD)":{},"BGColor (PD)":{},"BKG Demo (PD)":{},"BMP to NES Converter Example Doom 1 (PD)":{},"BMP to NES Converter Example Doom 2 (PD)":{},"BMP to NES Converter Example Falco (PD)":{},"BMP to NES Converter Example Firefox (PD)":{},"BMP to NES Converter Example Windows 3.1 (PD)":{},"BMX Simulator":{},"Babel no Tou":"{\"id\":\"26449\",\"GameTitle\":\"Babel no Tou\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"07/18/1986\",\"Overview\":\"In the beginning, an archaeologist and explorer known as Indiana Borgnine (インディー・ボーグナイン?), is in search of the fabled Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

The object is to earn popularity while performing concert tours through the fictional city. Celebrity challenges are included in the game; they are considered to be miniature games like swimming and kicking a giant ball into a goal in a manner similar to soccer. While these games are fun to play, losing results in a loss of popularity points similar to performing terribly at a concert.\\r\\n\\r\\nAppeasing senior citizens by performing gigs at the nursing home is another way to gain popularity. Otherwise, they will criticize the player's music or theatre styles without an end. After gaining the respect of the elderly, the mad faces eventually turn into frowns (and eventually smiles). Television appearances come in the form of talent shows, televised concerts, and several other surprises. The eventual goal is to convert all stadiums and concert venues to the player's colors. In addition to popularity meters for the players, music styles have their own popularity meters. Smiles with the player's colors determine which music styles are best liked by the player's fans. This determine what music or theatre styles to play and which ones to avoid in certain concert venues.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the talent contest, the show is like a tournament where four people compete in a semi-final format. After the judges give their score, the two players with the lowest score are eliminated. The players with the highest score end up competing in a final round where the highest scoring player is the winner and receives popularity points. During the actual performance, the player must choose his or her musical style(s) and must improvise the lyrics. During a televised concert, the game proceeds like in a normal concert. The only difference is that an increased number of popularity points are rewarded for a successful concert.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the player draws a certain combination on the dice, he or she must go to a nursing home and impress a grandmother with his or her musical or theatre styles.

However, the elderly people can get grumpy again if the player manages to make the grandmother angry each time that the player has to perform at the nursing home again.

Other combinations of the letter and number dice can create or ruin a player's popularity along with other side effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dice combination \\\"A-1\\\" is the best combination and it causes a rapid rise in popularity, which means more fans show up to the lucky person's concerts. Getting an \\\"F-5\\\" is the worst combination and will result in a loss of popularity. However, all other combinations can have either negative, neutral, or positive results for the player.

Each side is represented by a craft called a \\\"rotofoil\\\", which can be controlled by either a human player or a computer-controlled \\\"droid\\\" with ten levels of difficulty. (The game allows for human vs. human, human vs. droid, and droid vs. droid matches.) The basic objective of the game is to score points by either firing or carrying a floating ball into the opponent's goal. The game takes place on a flat, checkerboard playfield, and each player's half of the screen is presented in a first-person perspective.\\r\\n\\r\\nA player can gain possession of the ball by simply running into it, at which point it is held in a force field in front of the craft. The opponent can attempt to knock the ball away from the player using the fire button, and the player in possession of the ball can also fire the ball toward the goal. When a player does not have possession of the ball, his or her rotofoil automatically turns at 90-degree intervals to face the ball, while possessing the ball turns the player toward the opponent's goal. The goalposts move from side to side at each end of the playfield, and as goals are scored, the goal becomes narrower.\\r\\n\\r\\nPushing the ball through the goal scores one point, firing the ball through the posts from close range scores two points, and successfully scoring from long range (where the goalposts are not visible) scores three points. The maximum number of total points between the two players is ten, meaning that any points scored that would take the combined total above ten will cause the opponent's score to be reduced by the same amount, resulting in a kind of tug of war scoring system. The game ends when either a player successfully scores ten points or the timer runs out. If time runs out and the score is tied, the game goes into \\\"sudden death\\\", where the first player to score wins.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Pony Canyon\",\"Developer\":\"Lucasfilm Games\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"6\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"28824\",\"PlatformId\":\"4914\"},{\"id\":\"5129\",\"PlatformId\":\"26\"},{\"id\":\"4893\",\"PlatformId\":\"27\"},{\"id\":\"29850\",\"PlatformId\":\"30\"},{\"id\":\"6695\",\"PlatformId\":\"40\"},{\"id\":\"36720\",\"PlatformId\":\"4929\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/26454-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"422\",\"height\":\"289\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/26454-1.jpg\"}}}}","Balloon Fight":"{\"id\":\"333\",\"GameTitle\":\"Balloon Fight\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/02/1985\",\"Overview\":\"The player controls the unnamed Balloon Fighter with two balloons attached to his back.

Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form.  Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams' players.  Enhanced pitch control.  Ability to shift field formations when playing defense.  Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game.  Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired.  Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.)  Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting.  Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each.  New music and home run animations. These include the \\\"Power connect\\\" graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation.  Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams.  You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5.  Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum.  You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples 'STAR 5', 'ROOK 2', etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name.  Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves. (A peculiar glitch occurs when viewing league leaders. The last pitcher listed on any user-created team in \\\"View Team\\\" does not appear in any of the Top 10 leaderboards.)\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Sports\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Romstar\",\"Developer\":\"Eikichi Kawasaki and team\",\"Rating\":\"8\",\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/7816-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1280\",\"height\":\"720\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/7816-1.jpg\"},\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/7816-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"1533\",\"height\":\"2100\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/7816-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/7816-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"1539\",\"height\":\"2100\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/7816-1.jpg\"}}],\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/7816-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1280\",\"height\":\"720\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/7816-1.jpg\"},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/7816.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"165\"}}}}","Bases Loaded":"{\"id\":\"1032\",\"GameTitle\":\"Bases Loaded\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"06/26/1987\",\"Overview\":\"The game allows the player to control one of 12 teams in either a single game or a full season.

The game was advertised by the legendary monster truck of the same name in the cartoon segment of the 1990 television show Video Power, titled The Power Team.  The show also often used sound effects for the actions of not only Bigfoot, but others as well.  The gameplay involves racing monster trucks including the title truck, Bigfoot (blue). The computer controlled trucks are green (The Growler) and yellow (The Charger) if the computer's truck runs out of money and cannot repair their rig.  It was not uncommon for a skilled player to be challenged by three to four different monster trucks during the game.  In two player mode the 2nd player's truck is red.  The object of the game is to advance to the next level (race) with incurring the least amount of damage as possible.  The levels consist of car crushing, mud bog, tractor pull, hill climb and the later levels are a combination of everything except the sled pull, simply called a drag race.  To advance to the next event the player must complete a \\\"cross country\\\" race collecting money, points, etc. without damaging the truck.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Racing\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Acclaim\",\"Developer\":\"Beam Software Company, Ltd.\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"1\",\"Game\":{\"id\":\"37792\",\"PlatformId\":\"4953\"}},\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/1647-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1280\",\"height\":\"720\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/1647-1.jpg\"},\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/1647-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"1575\",\"height\":\"2100\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/1647-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/1647-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"1539\",\"height\":\"2100\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/1647-1.jpg\"}}],\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/1647-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1280\",\"height\":\"720\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/1647-1.jpg\"}}}","Bikkuriman World - Gekitou Sei Senshi":"{\"id\":\"26575\",\"GameTitle\":\"Bikkuriman World: Gekitou Sei Senshi\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"07/27/1992\",\"Overview\":\"Bikkuriman World: Gekitou Sei Senshi is a Role-Playing game, developed by Atlus and published by Hudson, which was released in Japan in 1990.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Role-Playing\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Hudson\",\"Developer\":\"Atlus\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/26575-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"285\",\"height\":\"400\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/26575-1.jpg\"}}}}","Bill & Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure":"{\"id\":\"1648\",\"GameTitle\":\"Bill & Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/01/1990\",\"Overview\":\"Bill & Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure is an action-adventure video game that is part of the Bill & Ted franchise and is based on the film Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure that was released in North America by LJN for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991.

They are informed that time-space rebels have gone back in time, kidnapping various historical figures and leaving them stranded in different time periods.  So now they must travel to the time periods, retrieve these figures and return them to their correct time periods.  This must be done as soon as possible; for if history isn't made right, the boys will miss the big concert that will launch Wyld Stallyns' music career.  Unfortunately, Rufus can only loan out a pay phonebooth for this trip.  Once the mission is explained, Ted leaves and Bill arrives later.  Rufus states that since they both came alone, it's best that they work separately.  From there Bill is brought up to speed on the situation.  Bill is instructed to go back in time and leave items to help Ted along the way in each time period he visits.  When Bill has done this he will start his own search.

In addition to those options, a CPU vs CPU mode and a CPU vs CPU quick mode are available in order to quicken up a tournament; the purpose is to see the stats of that particular match and quickly end tournaments.  The game uses city names but not the team names because of not having any proper licensing with Major League Baseball.  However, the players are purely fictional and they cannot be edited.

Bonk's mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur).  In the Arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself.  Bonk attacks enemies by \\\"bonking\\\" them with his large, invincible forehead.  Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage and three extra lives.  Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.  Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger.  There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable.  Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat.  The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time.  A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power but will eventually decay into the first stage of meat power, and then back into regular Bonk.  Eating a small meat while in stage two will put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power.  And eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.  Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart which restores all of Bonk's missing health.  There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.  Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air.  Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small \\\"smiley\\\" power-up.  Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage.  The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Platform\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"NEC Home Electronics\",\"Developer\":\"Red Company, Atlus\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"3\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"32738\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\"},{\"id\":\"18322\",\"PlatformId\":\"4\"},{\"id\":\"3777\",\"PlatformId\":\"34\"}]},\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/1654-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1280\",\"height\":\"720\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/1654-1.jpg\"},\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/1654-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"1533\",\"height\":\"2100\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/1654-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/1654-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"1539\",\"height\":\"2100\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/1654-1.jpg\"}}],\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/1654-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1280\",\"height\":\"720\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/1654-1.jpg\"},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/1654.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"204\"}}}}","Bonza":{},"Booby Kids":"{\"id\":\"26351\",\"GameTitle\":\"Booby Kids\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"07/10/1987\",\"Overview\":\"During the prehistoric era of humanity, cavemen and dinosaurs compete for ultimate supremacy.

The player's character is seen from behind and initially starts behind a protective wall (the wall can get damaged and shattered by enemy fire). The player must use a limitless ammunition gun and a limited number of grenades to fend off enemy troops and damage the base. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structures (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies. (A feature criticised by many players. It can be circumvented, however, if two players play simultaneously and at least one stays alive at a given moment.)\\r\\nPower-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen. Some power-ups give special weapons: One of them is an extremely fast machinegun and other one is an automatic shotgun with a slightly lower firing rate, but has a larger crosshair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot. Others grant extra grenades or additional points.\\r\\nTwo players could play this game, cooperatively, simultaneously.\\r\\nThe arcade cabinet is a standard upright. Each player uses a trackball to move the player from side to side, and move the crosshairs about the screen. On later board revisions, a joystick was installed instead with an optional sub-pcb for use with a trackball. With a trackball, rolling (an invincible movement during which the player could not attack) is done by pushing the trackball to maximum speed.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Shooter\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"Yes\",\"Publisher\":\"Milton Bradley Company\",\"Developer\":\"Zippo Games\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"4\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"41927\",\"PlatformId\":\"4911\"},{\"id\":\"26209\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\"},{\"id\":\"6714\",\"PlatformId\":\"40\"},{\"id\":\"35361\",\"PlatformId\":\"4913\"}]},\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/1660-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1280\",\"height\":\"720\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/1660-1.jpg\"},\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/1660-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"1502\",\"height\":\"2095\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/1660-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/1660-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"1529\",\"height\":\"2098\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/1660-1.jpg\"}}],\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/1660-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"480\",\"height\":\"360\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/1660-1.jpg\"},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/1660.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"187\"}}}}","Cadillac":{},"Caesars Palace":"{\"id\":\"1661\",\"GameTitle\":\"Caesars Palace\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"12/01/1992\",\"Overview\":\"This game allows you to play in the Caesars Palace casino.

Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip.

To prove that she has visited a particular location, she must drive around the location painting every section of the road white. However, the police, who have no tolerance for vandalism, attempt to stop the driver from completing her goal. The player's car can jump and fire cans of oil. To avoid forcing the player from retracing the same roads again, the roads change color when the car drives over them, indicating that that specific road has been painted. There are three main obstacles: police, cats and spikes. The police chase after the car and if a police car comes into contact with the main character's car, the car \\\"explodes\\\" by turning into a group of hearts and the player loses a life. To combat this, the player can obtain cans of oil, which can be used to cause the police cars to spin out of control, allowing the player to bump them off the screen. Other enemies include a cat, which, when hit, causes the player to lose an extra life as the cat goes diagonally off the screen (but does not cause the car to \\\"explode\\\") with playing of a comical music, \\\"Der Flohwalzer\\\", known as \\\"Neko Funjatta\\\" (I Stepped on the Cat) in Japan. There is also spikes, which make the car \\\"explode\\\" on contact. Occasionally, a balloon may float by during any given stage. If the car touches one of these balloons, it collects it and collecting three such balloons will activate a warp that sends the car multiple stages ahead and provides significant bonus points. Although the city you travel to will change, the difficulty pattern of the road will remain the same. As the number of cities you travel to loop endlessly, the game is not shortened by taking a warp. One particular thing about this game is the \\\"catchy\\\" tune that plays in the background as you enter a new city.

The bosses are a sea serpent (as seen on the cover), a giant crab, a giant squid, a red and black version of the sea serpent and a giant shark. The game uses a powerup bar similar to the Gradius series. Powerup pods are collected to move the selector to different powerup items. When the desired powerup is highlighted, the player can select it, after which the menu returns to an unhighlighted state. Menu options are \\\"Turbo\\\" (increase the speed of the boat), \\\"Fire\\\" (increase the number of bullets the primary gun fires), \\\"Speed\\\" (increase speed of shots and rate of fire), \\\"Missile\\\" (improves missiles) and \\\"Force\\\" (a force field around the boat plus replenished health). The speed boat used for game play starts with a single gun which can be upgraded to a quadruple spread shot. Missiles can also be added to the boat's arsenal and can be upgraded to heat-seekers. Between stages which are not connected by water, the Cobra Class has a helicopter style propeller that extends from the roof of the cabin. However, this flying state of the boat is never used in gameplay.

Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers.

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from \\\"cool\\\" to \\\"warm\\\", \\\"hot\\\", and \\\"critical\\\" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to \\\"cool\\\" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.\\r\\nThe standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well.\\r\\nThe standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.\\r\\nCyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first.

Deep Dungeon III: The Journey to the Hero) is the third installment in the Deep Dungeon series and the first to be released on the Famicom. This is the first Deep Dungeon title to offer the player a world to explore spanning multiple dungeons and multiple towns. It also allows the player to create their own party with up to three companions in addition to the hero character, with a choice of ranger, magician or priest for each character. Though the player can dismiss a character once the game has started, they will only be able to replace that character if they meet another pre-created playable character in one of the dungeons. However, the game will still end as soon as the protagonist \\\"swordsman\\\" character is defeated. This game retains the player-adjustable level-up stats from the first game, as well as the feature that removes randomized encounters if the player is at a significantly higher experience level than needed for their current location. One exclusive and rather annoying feature of this game engine is that sometimes the player character will fumble (remove) their equipped weapon, wasting that character's turn. If the player wishes to re-arm their weapon, it will cost the player another turn. This is the only game in the series to award the player money (Gold) when defeating enemies. All other games will force the player to re-enter maps to collect respawning chests for money or items (for resale) if they want to gold farm.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Role-Playing\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Square\",\"Developer\":\"HummingBirdSoft\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/26765-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"579\",\"height\":\"800\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/26765-1.jpg\"}}}}","Deep Dungeon IV - Kuro no Youjutsushi":"{\"id\":\"26766\",\"GameTitle\":\"Deep Dungeon IV: Kuro no Youjutsushi\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"04/06/1990\",\"Overview\":\"Deep Dungeon IV: Kuro no Yōjutsushi (ディープダンジョンIV 黒の妖術師?, lit.

Through the game, the player will meet up to two additional playable characters with predetermined class. This game also reverts to the standard practice or randomizing characters' stat growth when gaining an experience level. New to this engine is that the player can eventually learn to summon two monsters to function as a temporary additional party member for a single battle. It also removed the feature that stops random battles when the player is significantly more powerful than the enemies. This isn't as bad as it seems as the maps in this game are also much smaller (whereas the previous games used multi-floor dungeons up to 32x32 tiles, the dungeons in this game are either single floor, or multiple floors that can fit within a single 32x32 map) In this game, the player can accept \\\"requests\\\" from the non-player characters.

When in a one-player game, the second controller can be used to modify the CPU forces. When playing against the CPU, the computer will be given a different ratio of units to command than the player.

Units have different mobility range, which varies according to the unit type and (except for aircraft) the terrain.

In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor. At the start of the game, the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as submachine guns, explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However, bullets have minimal range, only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane's health, which is drained by bullet wounds, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost. The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fifth level. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game's final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans and any of the 40 terrorists left alive. One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However, after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the \\\"foot meter\\\". The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits. The game features cinematic sequences which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example, if there is fewer than one minute left and the player defeats Karl, the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the helicopter sent by Hans.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Activision\",\"Developer\":\"Pack-In-Video\",\"Rating\":\"4\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"3\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"27066\",\"PlatformId\":\"40\"},{\"id\":\"25281\",\"PlatformId\":\"1\"},{\"id\":\"23276\",\"PlatformId\":\"34\"}]},\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/1695-2.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/1695-2.jpg\"},\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/1695-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"1540\",\"height\":\"2100\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/1695-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/1695-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"1526\",\"height\":\"2100\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/1695-1.jpg\"}}],\"banner\":{\"_\":\"graphical/1695-g.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"760\",\"height\":\"140\"}},\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/1695-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1280\",\"height\":\"720\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/1695-1.jpg\"}}}","Difference":{},"Diffusion Chamber by Michael Martin (PD)":{},"Diffusion Chamber by Michael Martin (PD) ":{},"Dig Dug":"{\"id\":\"45309\",\"GameTitle\":\"Dig Dug\",\"PlatformId\":\"4936\",\"Platform\":\"Famicom Disk System\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"07/20/1990\",\"Overview\":\"Create your own maze as you tunnel fearlessly through the earth.

Rounds one and two were 10-question trivia rounds, each of which started with a toss-up challenge. Round three – the obstacle course – featured eight stages to be completed within 60 seconds. Toss-up challenges determined which team got initial control of the trivia round. To complete a toss-up, each player had to determine the precise speed and angle of whatever object they were throwing to hit a target.  Physical challenges were played the same way. All questions were multiple choice, and each player could use the up or down arrows on the controller to make his selection. Three possible answers and either a dare, double dare, or physical challenge option were offered. The player confirmed his selection by pressing the A button. Confirming a dare doubled the base dollar value of the question; a double dare quadrupled the base dollar value. The player with the most money at the end of round two went on to the obstacle course. In order to move through an obstacle, the player had to repeatedly alternate between pressing either the left and right or up and down arrows on the controller's D-pad. In order to grab the flag, the player had to position the on-screen contestant in just the right spot and then press the A button to jump and retrieve it. Some found it easier to get through the course by using the NES Advantage, a joystick controller, rather than the NES' standard controller. The obstacles are all based on real obstacles from the show (with one exception) and are randomized before a game. They include The Tank, The 1-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, The Fireman's Flagpole, The Monkey Bars, \\\"Dallas\\\", Mount St. Double Dare, Moonwalk, and an original obstacle designed like a triangular jungle gym. \\\"Prizes\\\" for beating the obstacle course included a BMX bicycle, television set, an NES console, and several other gifts, ending with a exotic vacation -- though it can prove very difficult to get the best \\\"ending\\\" by completing the last obstacle. The obstacle course's flag colour depended on which team was playing, if blue, the flags were blue, and if red, the flags were red.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Puzzle\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"GameTek\",\"Developer\":\"Rare\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/1698-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"360\",\"height\":\"513\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/1698-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/1698-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"350\",\"height\":\"495\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/1698-1.jpg\"}}],\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/1698-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1280\",\"height\":\"720\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/1698-1.jpg\"}}}","Double Dragon":"{\"id\":\"208\",\"GameTitle\":\"Double Dragon\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/01/1987\",\"Overview\":\"Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers who learned to fight on the cold, tough streets of the city.

While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles.\\r\\nThe remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting \\\"Tidy Item\\\" and \\\"Tidy Bag\\\" commands; and the \\\"Full HP\\\" command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells.\\r\\nWhile the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another \\\"major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.\\\"\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Role-Playing\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Enix\",\"Developer\":\"Enix\",\"Rating\":\"5.3333\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"1\",\"Game\":{\"id\":\"8614\",\"PlatformId\":\"41\"}},\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/1700-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1280\",\"height\":\"720\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/1700-1.jpg\"},\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/1700-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"1535\",\"height\":\"2100\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/1700-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/1700-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"350\",\"height\":\"495\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/1700-1.jpg\"}}],\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/1700-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1280\",\"height\":\"720\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/1700-1.jpg\"}}}","Dragon Warrior IV":"{\"id\":\"1275\",\"GameTitle\":\"Dragon Warrior IV\",\"AlternateTitles\":{\"title\":\"Dragon Quest IV\"},\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"10/12/1992\",\"Overview\":\"Dragon Quest IV differs from the rest of the series by breaking up the game into five distinct chapters, each of which focuses on a different protagonist or protagonists.

With these winnings they can repair or upgrade various components of the hydroplane to improve racing performance and remain competitive in the increasingly-difficult races. Eliminator Boat Duel offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Completing a race at a lower difficulty level advances the player to the next higher one. At each difficulty level, the player's hydroplane can be damaged from impact with animals, the opponent's hydroplane, and various stationary objects. A false start is penalized with a $2,000 fine. For most of a race, players control their hydroplanes from a bird's-eye view, and the screen scrolls in multiple directions; but in one segment of the race, the graphical perspective changes to a third-person tracking mode. In a single-player game, the player competes first with Seasick Sidney (in Easy mode), with Aquarius Rex (in Normal mode), or with Surfer Bob (in Expert mode). The player then competes against Vicious Vicky, Weird Willy, Mangler Mike, Veronica Alabaster, and Disaster Don (the reigning World Champion), respectively.

Otherwise, the player loses a chance and the player must start the stage over again. The host of the televised game show, J. D. Roth, congratulates players for winning a stage while taunting the player with late 1980s/early 1990s sarcasm when he loses a \\\"chance.\\\" Icy floors and slime colored ramps offer an additional challenge to the player. There are 72 rooms in the entire Fun House; with targets that are either numbered or given a generic target graphic. Each room has a name that usually gives a clue about how the room's design is implemented. Although the player is given three chances to successfully navigate the entire Fun House, collecting 25 silver coins acts as a 1-up. Warp zones will allow players to access the more difficult levels of the Fun House at an earlier time; thus allowing gamers who are pressed for time a chance to beat the game with a higher level of risk.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Hi Tech Expressions\",\"Developer\":\"Realtime Associates, Inc.\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/1831-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"364\",\"height\":\"524\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/1831-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/1831-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"350\",\"height\":\"495\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/1831-1.jpg\"}}]}}","Fushigi no Umi no Nadia":"{\"id\":\"26877\",\"GameTitle\":\"Fushigi no Umi Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"03/15/1991\",\"Overview\":\"Fushigi no Umi Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water is a Strategy game, developed by Advance Communication Company and published by Toho, which was released in Japan in 1991.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Strategy\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Toho\",\"Developer\":\"Advance Communication Company\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/26877-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"600\",\"height\":\"866\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/26877-1.jpg\"}}}}","Fuuun Shaolin Kyo":"{\"id\":\"33176\",\"GameTitle\":\"Fuuun Shourin Ken\",\"AlternateTitles\":{\"title\":[\"風雲少林拳\",\"Elements of the Shaolin Fist\"]},\"PlatformId\":\"4936\",\"Platform\":\"Famicom Disk System\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"04/27/1987\",\"Overview\":\"In Fuuun Shourin Ken, you control a rising martial artist who strives to defeat other great fighters.

The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.\\r\\nGalaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's \\\"hit/miss ratio\\\" at the end of the game, and a bonus \\\"Challenging Stage\\\" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy.\\r\\nAnother gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a \\\"boss Galaga\\\" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large.\\r\\nGalaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous \\\"Split-Screen bug\\\" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game \\\"rolls over\\\" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Shooter\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Midway\",\"Developer\":\"Namco\",\"Rating\":\"6.6667\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"5\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"7861\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\"},{\"id\":\"44093\",\"PlatformId\":\"22\"},{\"id\":\"4899\",\"PlatformId\":\"27\"},{\"id\":\"45342\",\"PlatformId\":\"4936\"},{\"id\":\"35838\",\"PlatformId\":\"4929\"}]},\"Images\":{\"fanart\":[{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/1834-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/1834-1.jpg\"},{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/1834-2.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/1834-2.jpg\"}],\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/1834-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"1536\",\"height\":\"2100\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/1834-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/1834-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"1527\",\"height\":\"2100\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/1834-1.jpg\"}}],\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/1834-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"480\",\"height\":\"360\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/1834-1.jpg\"},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/1834.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"193\"}}}}","Galaxian":"{\"id\":\"45344\",\"GameTitle\":\"Galaxian\",\"PlatformId\":\"4936\",\"Platform\":\"Famicom Disk System\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"07/20/1990\",\"Overview\":\"The Galaxian Fleet has invaded and it's up to you to stop them.

Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Yokai Army) is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong. The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and yōkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller.\\r\\n\\r\\nGegege no Kitarou 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Role-Playing\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Bandai\",\"Developer\":\"Bandai\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/26888-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"299\",\"height\":\"210\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/26888-1.jpg\"}}}}","Geimos":{},"Gekitotsu Yonku Battle":"{\"id\":\"26892\",\"GameTitle\":\"Gekitotsu Yonku Battle\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"11/17/1989\",\"Overview\":\"Gekitotsu Shiku Battle (激突四駆バトル?, \\\"Four Wheel Drive Battle Clash\\\") is a Japan-exclusive video game of the vehicular combat game genre released in 1989 by Irem for the Family Computer.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Irem\",\"Developer\":\"Tamtex\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/26892-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"163\",\"height\":\"228\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/26892-1.jpg\"}}}}","Gemfire":"{\"id\":\"1837\",\"GameTitle\":\"Gemfire\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"06/24/1992\",\"Overview\":\"The game takes place in the fictitious Isle of Ishmeria.

Two players take it in turns to place a single Go tile on the board, attempting to craft their own lines while strategically placing tiles that blocks the opponent from finishing theirs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the normal board game is simply referred to as \\\"Gomoku Narabe\\\" (Five Pieces in a Row, occasionally translated as Gobang), the Renju modifier is an additional rule that makes it harder for the player with the black pieces to win. Because the black player always begins each game (like how the white player always begins each game of Chess), this additional rule is thought to even the playing field. The rule is that the black player will lose if they build a line of six or more pieces: this counts as going \\\"overlong\\\" and counts as a loss.\\r\\n\\r\\nGomoku Narabe Renju is the joint-fourth video game ever released on the Famicom, and the joint-first original game produced for the system (the previous three - Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Popeye - were all ports of Arcade games).

Born November 15, 1939, Naito has been a professional Shoji player since he was 18 years old. In addition to helping with this video game, Naito Kudan is a published author, having 13 books written about Shoji and running a column in the sports section of the newspaper. He is also a published singer but mostly does it as a hobby.

There is no ability to change the difficulty or handicap. Most of the screen is the Shoji board, but there is also a representation of the player and computer playing Shoji in a Japanese setting, which moves as the game moves. The player always starts first, with the fastest possible way to beat the computer set at 15 hands/turns.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonshogi: Naitou Kudan Shogi Hiden was entered into the first annual World Computer Shoji Championship in 1990.

Jumbo Ozaki no Hole in One Professional features the likeness of Japan's most prominent golf player, Masashi \\\"Jumbo\\\" Ozaki - the Jumbo nickname comes from his unusual height for a Japanese male: almost 6'. Though featured on the box art and in the title, Jumbo Ozaki makes no obvious appearance in-game.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough by all practical metrics a perfectly standard overhead golf simulator - players take it in turn to get the ball to the hole in as few shots as possible, selecting the direction, club used and power of each shot - the game does do things a little differently than usual. Specifically, the visual cue for the power of the shot comes from the depiction of the golfer himself: The player must monitor the character as he swings, hitting the button at both the apex and nadir of the swing for maximum effect. This replaces the usual sliding power bar that most golf games have. Failure to hit the swing precisely will lead to slices and hooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game can be played as a single player Stroke Match, which allows the player to practice on each of the game's 36 holes across two different courses. The player can also play against another human, or rate their score against CPU opponents in the 1 Day and 4 Day modes.

The player is then given an assortment of pieces while the opponent appears to have the same number of instances of the same piece, though in truth their real forms are concealed from the human player.

The goal is to figure out what pieces the opponent is attacking with and take them out - sometimes it is possible to ascertain what piece it is with how many spaces it can move, but the most reliable method is to see which pieces it is able to defeat, recalling its place on the rock-scissors-paper chain and then using a piece strong against it to finish it off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game, like all shogi simulators, was never released outside of Japan.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Strategy\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Sofel\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/40539-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"300\",\"height\":\"203\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/40539-1.jpg\"}}}}","Kagerou Densetsu":"{\"id\":\"27159\",\"GameTitle\":\"Kagerou Densetsu\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"05/11/1990\",\"Overview\":\"Kagerou Densetsu is a Role-Playing game, developed by ITL and published by Pixel Multimedia, which was released in Japan in 1990.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Role-Playing\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Pixel Multimedia\",\"Developer\":\"ITL\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/27159-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"273\",\"height\":\"392\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/27159-1.jpg\"}}}}","Kaguya Hime Densetsu":"{\"id\":\"27160\",\"GameTitle\":\"Kaguya Hime Densetsu\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"12/16/1988\",\"Overview\":\"Kaguya Hime Densetsu is an Adventure game, developed by Micronics and published by Victor Interactive Software, which was released in Japan in 1988.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Adventure\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Victor Interactive Software\",\"Developer\":\"Micronics\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/27160-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"295\",\"height\":\"208\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/27160-1.jpg\"}}}}","Kaijuu Monogatari":"{\"id\":\"27161\",\"GameTitle\":\"Kaijuu Monogatari\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"11/18/1988\",\"Overview\":\"Kaijū Monogatari (貝獣物語?) is a role-playing video game developed by Birthday and published by Namco for Famicom, in November 1988 in Japan.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Role-Playing\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Namco\",\"Developer\":\"Birthday\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/27161-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"568\",\"height\":\"812\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/27161-1.jpg\"}}}}","Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2 - Karakuri Land":"{\"id\":\"27162\",\"GameTitle\":\"Kaiketsu Yancha Maru 2: Karakuri Land\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"08/30/1991\",\"Overview\":\"Kaiketsu Yancha Maru 2: Karakuri Land is an Action game, developed and published by Irem, which was released in Japan in 1991.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Irem\",\"Developer\":\"Irem\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/27162-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"170\",\"height\":\"241\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/27162-1.jpg\"}}}}","Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3 - Taiketsu!

It is based on the 1986 film of the same name which was directed by Jim Henson, produced by George Lucas, and featuring David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King, and Jennifer Connelly as Sarah Williams. Although it was published by Activision, who held the world right publishing rights to video game adaptations of the movie, it is distinctly different from the version of Labyrinth which was developed by Lucasfilm Games (now LucasArts), and published by Activision for the Commodore 64/128, Apple II, and MSX2.\\r\\n\\r\\n15 year old Sarah is so resentful of her baby brother Toby that she hopes he will just disappear. Her dream becomes reality when goblins kidnap the boy—but Sarah unexpectedly finds herself horrified by the loss. So she sets forth to retrieve him, and finds herself on the adventure of a lifetime. To accomplish her task, she will somehow have to reach the center of the fantastical labyrinth where the wicked Goblin King has imprisoned the lad. But the task is easier said than done, for the maze is filled with strange creatures and mind-bending puzzles that confuse the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the film was fairly successful in the United States, it developed a rather large following in Japan. Developed Tokuma Shoten created this action-adventure game that was more accurate to the film than the Lucasfilms Games version. The gameplay employed a top-down view similar to The Legend of Zelda, and featured many interesting tricks and puzzles, including levels that played with spatial relationships. Walking through certain avenues found in the levels would seamlessly warp you to another location in the level without any noticeable indication; the surrounding environment of the destination was designed to match the environment of the origin completely. Instead of using a health meter, a running clock displays how much time is remaining, and contact with enemies removes bits of time.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Activision\",\"Developer\":\"Tokuma Shoten\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"3\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"35236\",\"PlatformId\":\"4954\"},{\"id\":\"33844\",\"PlatformId\":\"4929\"},{\"id\":\"41059\",\"PlatformId\":\"8\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/27172-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"384\",\"height\":\"257\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/27172-1.jpg\"}}}}","Labyrinth Demo (PD)":{},"Lagrange Point":"{\"id\":\"26474\",\"GameTitle\":\"Lagrange Point\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"04/26/1991\",\"Overview\":\"In the 22nd century, mankind has begun to emigrate into outer space.

The scene is the town's main street, with a view from behind the Sheriff's back (the view is so close that only the Sheriff's waist, right arm and gun are visible). Various other characters appear on the main street in front of the Sheriff.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actual gameplay mostly concerns the Sheriff discussing with the various characters via a selection menu similar to those in contemporary graphical adventures. For each line the other character says, the game offers a selection of four different responses, and the discussion progresses depending on the chosen response. Law of the West marks the first use of this now-common interaction style.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as the discussion, the Sheriff occasionally gets involved in gunfights. In this case, the gameplay becomes a pure test of shooting skills, as the Sheriff has to shoot his opponent before getting shot himself. Gunplay is accomplished by pushing up on the joystick to draw the weapon, which causes a joystick-controlled crosshairs to appear on the screen. The various characters would react if the Sheriff drew his gun before they had a chance to say their opening line, usually refusing to speak until the gun was put away.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Sheriff gets shot, he blacks out, and the doctor is called to help. Depending on the Sheriff's previous interaction with the doctor and the other characters in the game (and if the doctor's in town), he may either be healed, or left for dead (either by the doctor refusing to help, or the doctor being drunk at the time). The only goal of the game is for the player to make it alive to the end of the day; if the player wishes he can gun down every character he meets without talking to them albeit this will be reflected negatively in the final score.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Adventure\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Pony Canyon\",\"Developer\":\"TOSE\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"1\",\"Game\":{\"id\":\"38326\",\"PlatformId\":\"40\"}},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/27174-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"432\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/27174-1.jpg\"}}}}","Lawn Mower by shiru (PD)":"{\"id\":\"40027\",\"GameTitle\":\"Lawn Mower\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"Overview\":\"Juego arcade donde tenemos el control de un cortacésped, creado por Shiru\",\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/40027-1.png\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"204\",\"height\":\"179\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/40027-1.png\"}}}}","Lawn Mower by shiru (PD) (2011-05-30)":{},"Layla":{},"Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf":"{\"id\":\"1882\",\"GameTitle\":\"Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"03/24/1988\",\"Overview\":\"Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf is a Golf Sim game, developed and published by SNK, which was released in 1988.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Sports\"},\"Players\":\"4+\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"SNK\",\"Developer\":\"SNK\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/1882-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"1540\",\"height\":\"2100\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/1882-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/1882-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"1526\",\"height\":\"2100\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/1882-1.jpg\"}}]}}","Legacy of the Wizard":"{\"id\":\"1478\",\"GameTitle\":\"Legacy of the Wizard\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"07/17/1987\",\"Overview\":\"Long, long ago, an evil dragon terrorized the forest until it was imprisoned by a powerful wizard.

The goal is to use a pair of arrows to teleport pachinko balls around a maze to the scoring zones, and away from the \\\"Out\\\" zone. It was originally developed for Arcades and ported to MSX and the Famicom.\\r\\n\\r\\nLot Lot is a puzzle game involving pachinko balls and has a superficiality similarity to that popular Japanese gambling game. Instead of firing the balls around a table full of pins that change their course, the goal is to make sure the balls run into one of the four troughs that score points, with the higher numbered scoring zones being preferable. If any drop into the \\\"Out\\\" zone, the game is over.\\r\\n\\r\\nTokuma Shoten Publishing is a major conglomerate in Japan that mostly publishes magazines, though in the 80s they tried branching out into other mediums as well. Lot Lot is one of their earliest forays into publishing video games, and is the first game of theirs to be published for the NES/Famicom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe player changes the destination of these balls with a pair of arrows: A pink arrow and a green arrow. Pressing the action button will switch the contents of the two boxes the two arrows are hovering over. The pink arrow goes where the player directs and the green allow follows the same path with a slight time delay. The idea is to pass over the first box that the player wants to teleport balls from and move over to a second box they wish to teleport to, and waiting until the green arrow passes over the original box before pressing the button. The walls of the maze will randomly open and close for limited durations, so the player must send the right balls to the right box quickly in order for them to drain into the scoring zones (or lure them away from draining into the Out zone).

Once an enemy is defeated and offscreen, a spirit will appear and ascend to the top of the screen. It can be collected before it has disappeared to receive points, which vary depending on the enemy. Sakura will sometimes drop petals that the player can collect, and Damazu will sometimes run around, dropping bombs.

While ostensibly a racing game, the style of gameplay tends to change per level.\\r\\n\\r\\nParis-Dakar Rally Special! is an unusual racing game in which the player must successfully win the Paris-Dakar Rally. However, in order to do so, the player is faced with a wide variety of odd challenges to overcome, a scant number of which actually involve racing.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeveloped by ISCO for the NES, Paris-Dakar Rally is notorious for its bizarre structure. Depending on who is asked it is either a testament to the NES library's occasionally creative and off-beat ingenuity, or a legendary \\\"kusoge\\\" (crap game).\\r\\n\\r\\nStage 1 - Preparation\\r\\nIn the first stage the player is without vehicle. In order to race in the Paris-Dakar Rally, the player must first acquire a sponsor, some money, a car and a navigation partner. In order to achieve these objectives, the player must walk around town and talk to the right order of sponsors, executives, bank tellers and rally co-ordinators to begin. Once the car has been purchased and a navigation partner chosen (which is resolved with a fast reactions mini-game), the player can take a plane to Paris to begin the rally.\\r\\n\\r\\nStage 2 - First Day\\r\\nThe first day races most closely resemble an actual racing game. The player has a top-down view of a vertically-scrolling track and must control the car's speed and direction with the D-pad. In order to qualify for the next stage of the event, the player must make it through the course within a time limit while dodging hostile vehicles from behind and in front. Losing three lives restarts the stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nStage 3 - Second Day\\r\\nThis mode more closely resembles the Arcade game Rally-X. The player must maneuver and corner around the Parisian streets in order to avoid rival drivers. They can distract pursuing CPU opponents by dropping rubber balls (possibly tires) behind the player's car to deter them.\\r\\n\\r\\nStage 4 - Third Day\\r\\nThe action changes to a side-scrolling perspective and now the player must contend with birds dropping deadly eggs, bridges that collapse once driven on, rolling boulders, fires and other obstacles on the racecourse. Occasionally, the player will need to leave the vehicle in order to hit a switch to extend a bridge before they can continue.\\r\\n\\r\\nStage 5 - Fourth Day\\r\\nAs the player is on a variant of the Paris-Dakar course that will inconveniently cross a major sea, the player must steer their car-boat over and under the ocean and avoid various hostile sea creatures and jagged rocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nStage 6 - Fifth Day\\r\\nInto the Dakar desert, the player must drive vertically up the screen while avoiding vicious desert animals like snakes, scorpions, spiders, camels and other hostile racers. The player must also contend with some narrow walls and a section where they must cross between two rafts.\\r\\n\\r\\nStage 7 - Sixth Day\\r\\nAt some point between starting the race and the sixth day, World War 3 broke out and the player must use their newly mounted machine guns to take down the enemy aircraft and tanks between them and the finishing line.\\r\\n\\r\\nStage 8 - Final Day\\r\\nThe Dakar finish line is just ahead, all the player must do is survive a gauntlet similar to that of the First Day. As with that stage, the player must be alert for other racers all around them and make it to the end within the time limit.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Action\"},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"CBS Sony Group\",\"Developer\":\"ISCO\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/40637-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"444\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/40637-1.jpg\"}}}}","Parodius":"{\"id\":\"2003\",\"GameTitle\":\"Parodius\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\",\"Platform\":\"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"11/30/1990\",\"Overview\":\"One day, our octopus friend gets into a fight to the death with his old rival, the bug.

Receiving numerous TV and film adaptations, including the 1983 film known in the west as Legend of the Eight Samurai, Satomi Hakkenden would be its first video game adaptation. Makai Hakkenden Shada for the Turbografx-16, also released in 1989, would be a later adaptation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game itself plays much like Dragon Quest; a common source of inspiration for 8-bit RPGs. The player can walk around towns conversing with NPCs, equipping themselves with weapons and armor and receiving quests and directions to new areas before leaving the safety of the town to fight random encounters on the overworld map that links locations together.

The Rastons are after the crystals also, which places a short time limit on the mission. You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.)

This was a groundbreaking feature at the time. It was also the first game to depict an existing stadium with it's actual name, the Tokyo Dome, which had just opened shortly before the game's release. Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time, was chosen to help promote the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field.

The objective of the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. With every ten lines that are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the tetrominoes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter. In certain versions, the game can also end if the player is able to get all the way to level 15.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the tetrominoes are capable of single and double clears. I, J, and L are able to clear triples. Only the I tetromino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously, and this is referred to as a \\\"tetris\\\". (This may vary depending on the rotation and compensation rules of each specific Tetris implementation.

Tengen, an ambitious Atari-associated game developer, began releasing official NES games in 1988. Meanwhile, the company worked rapidly behind the scenes to override Nintendo's infamous lockout device that kept unofficial cartridges from being played on its console. When Tengen released its first unofficial games using its new technology, Nintendo quickly sued. This was just the beginning of the Tengen/Nintendo feud. Ignoring Nintendo's claim to the Tetris name in the US a year later, Tengen released its own version of the world's most famous puzzle game on an unlocked, unofficial cartridge. Tengen's tetris was pulled from shelves almost immediately when it was revealed that Nintendo's hold on the Tetris name stateside was legitimate. Unfortunately, almost everyone agrees that Tengen's version of the game was far superior to Nintendo's, even including a two-player mode which Nintendo's version sorely lacked. Today, the game known as Tengen Tetris is a rare title to have in your collection, but it's a worthwhile play.

The game is the first in the Babylonian Castle Saga and second chronologically. In 1992, the game was remade for the PC Engine which saw numerous changes detailed below.\\r\\n\\r\\nCombining hack & slash real-time combat with some basic RPG elements, it laid the foundations for early action role-playing games such as Dragon Slayer and Hydlide. Its hack & slash combat included the ability to both attack with a sword by pressing the attack button and defend with a shield by standing still. It attracted millions of fans in Japan and went on to inspire early action RPGs such as Dragon Slayer, Hydlide, Ys and The Legend of Zelda. The game also debuted the Slime monsters which would later become the mascot of the Dragon Quest series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game served the basis of an anime series, The Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of Uruk, from studio Gonzo and was broadcast between April 2008 to March 2009.

The object is to acquire all of the enemies' territory and defeat the evil gang leaders. Even though this game was only released in Japan, the gangsters fight without any weapons and the violence level is mild compared to later gang-related games. Its spiritual descendant is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas due to its simulation of gang warfare.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the main gang leader is defeated in either Tsuppari Wars (ツッパリウォーズ?) or Tsuppari Suku (ツッパリスク?) mode, the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently, all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the \\\"neutral gangs.\\\" These \\\"neutral gangs\\\" will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue, or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying \\\"no\\\" when asked to fight (たたかい?, \\\"Struggle\\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nNeutral gangs, fortunately, do not have ability to invade the territories of the red, blue, or green colored gangs. There are three difficulty levels for computer opponents and games are possible with two or three colors (but never with only one color). After naming the character (using the Japanese alphabet), the player must select his face that will represent his main gang leader. The two gang leaders involved will use a special fighting game engine to settle their differences while individual gang members will fight each other through a special battle screen. The battle screen allows players to use special effects against the opponent like a motorcycle, a thunderstorm, or even a quick call to the police's riot squad. All brawls are timed by a timer which is never seen in the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat means if there is no determined winner in a certain number of time, the brawl ends with a stalemate and no territory gains or losses are made. The brawl can be re-initiated either during the player's next turn or during the opponent's turn. There are eight different maps to choose from that depict the world in a manner similar to the board game Risk. There are islands with land bridges and bodies of water to them. Between combat, the player can either move (いどうし?, \\\"Not among\\\") his gang members from territory to territory or immediately end his turn.

All the animals were docile. Humans, Sandras, Quarkmen, Tattas, and other races mingled with one another and worked to make Marvel Land into an increasingly beautiful place to live. A large clock tower resembling a stone grandfather clock stood watch over the countryside of Marvel Land. Long ago, an ancient evil had been sealed within the clock tower. The people needn't fret, however. For those days had long since passed, or so they had thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key of time that rested in the center of the face of the clock tower had long since been used to seal away the ancient evil that lies within. Until one day, the clock tower mysteriously stopped working. In an effort to rewind the clock, a villager takes it upon himself to do just that. Fumbling with the key, the villager drops the key of time, foolishly. In a frantic manner, the villager picks up the key and tries to reset it back into place before a catastrophe befalls Marvel Land. But then, it was too late for the villager to accomplish the task. The ancient evil of legend. Zouna, the Dark Wizard who manipulates time itself was unleashed upon the world once more. And to prevent anyone else from sealing him away once again, Zouna takes the key of time for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally freed after many years, Zouna wastes no time in wreaking havoc and chaos over Marvel Land. Zouna unleashes his manifested darkness over the land, and lays waste to the countryside. Feeling confident in his reign, Zouna constructs his castle in which to preside over Marvel Land from. The peaceful inhabitants of Marvel Land cried out in terror as Zouna's manifested darkness came after them one by one. Zouna's darkness corrupted the hearts of anyone it came across, and possessed them against their wills. Once thriving towns and villages fell into ruination. Family members were parted from their loved ones. Only a few scattered towns remained standing; forming a last bastion in resistance to Zouna's dark invasion. A futile effort. Even Krino Sandra (known as Whirlo in Europe) would come to meet his heroic demise, subdued by Zouna's power. Marvel Land is in dire need of a savior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe desperate call has been answered by the heavens. Valkyrie, a fledgling shield maiden descends to Marvel Land from heaven.

One day, an evil army attacked this peaceful little kingdom and stole the Triforce of Power. This army was led by Ganon, the powerful Prince of Darkness who sought to plunge the World into fear and darkness under his rule. Fearing his wicked rule, Zelda, the princess of this kingdom, split up the Triforce of Wisdom into eight fragments and hid them throughout the realm to save the last remaining Triforce from the clutches of the evil Ganon. At the same time, she commanded her most trustworthy nursemaid, Impa, to secretly escape into the land and go find a man with enough courage to destroy the evil Ganon. Upon hearing this, Ganon grew angry, imprisoned the princess, and sent out a party in search of Impa.\\r\\n\\r\\nBraving forests and mountains, Impa fled for her life from her pursuers.

He held the Triforce of Power. And so, in order to fight off Ganon, Link had to bring the scattered eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom together to rebuild the mystical triangle.
