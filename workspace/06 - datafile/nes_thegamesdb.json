This version, however, had very poor physics; to kill a pig, you had to hit it straight on, and you could not kill one by knocking into the fortress.

Each stage ends with the same boss battle; a large Mega Argus fortress with a slow flashing core at its center, and the only way to destroy this pernicious mothership is to bomb its core when it is fully exposed.

There is also another character moving around on the board, and if the player is on the same space as him, they can choose to be sent into a boss battle, which has to be cleared to move onto the next world.","Genres":{"genre":"Platform"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"IGS","Developer":"AIM","Rating":"5","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/26248-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"427","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/26248-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/26248-1.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/26248-1.jpg"}}},"Artelius":{},"Asmik-kun Land":{"id":"26250","GameTitle":"Asmik-kun Land","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"12/20/1991","Overview":"Recently, monsters began to invade the peaceful country of the dragons.

The game was ported by Data East to the Family Computer in 1986, and was Data East's very first home release for this platform.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of 45 levels (30 in the Family Computer version), and no background story or plot is given. The player controls a ship called the FX-1, and collects power-up parts (called a \"wing\") to progress through the levels and ultimately defeat the Gobunasu armored mobile fortress in the final level. The game consists of two different top-view screen levels, where the player can press the second button to descend to the ground whenever they do not have a power-up. The player is unaffected by attacks from airborne units while they are playing on the ground level, but the ship is automatically brought back into the air after a certain period of time. The player can still be hit by attacks from ground units while they are on the ground level, and can also lose their ship by crashing into obstacles. The 8-way joystick controls the player's movements, and one button is used for shooting, and the other is used for descending to the ground (or un-equipping wings). The background image continues infinitely when the player scrolls in the horizontal directions.\r\n\r\nCompleting the final level of the game causes the score counter to increase to 9,999,999 points, which the player can enter as their high score. The player can also score cheap points by equipping and un-equipping their power-up. Pressing the button twice while the un-equipping animation is occurring cause the player to gain 2,000 points. The player gains an extra life every 40,000 points, so it is possible to gain lives almost infinitely. If the player gains over 10,000,000 points in this way before completing the final level, the counter takes over 20 minutes to increase to 99,999,999 points.","Genres":{"genre":"Shooter"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Data East","Developer":"Data East","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"34438","PlatformId":"23"}},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/21127-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"414","height":"280","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/21127-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/21127-1.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/21127-1.jpg"}}},"B00DaW's Pokemon Demo (PD)":{},"BAPSACRSTRKCGTF (Demo Phase 1) (AKA B00daw's Folly) (PD)":{},"BAPSACRSTRKCGTF (Demo Phase 2) (AKA B00daw's Folly) (PD)":{},"BGColor (PD)":{},"BKG Demo (PD)":{},"BMP to NES Converter Example Doom 1 (PD)":{},"BMP to NES Converter Example Doom 2 (PD)":{},"BMP to NES Converter Example Falco (PD)":{},"BMP to NES Converter Example Firefox (PD)":{},"BMP to NES Converter Example Windows 3.1 (PD)":{},"BMX Simulator":{},"Babel no Tou":{"id":"26449","GameTitle":"Babel no Tou","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"07/18/1986","Overview":"In the beginning, an archaeologist and explorer known as Indiana Borgnine (インディー・ボーグナイン?), is in search of the fabled Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

Star Monomane Shitennō (爆笑!　スターものまね四天王?, \"A Hearty Laugh! Imitation of the Four Heavenly Kings Star\") is a Nintendo Family Computer life simulation video game that portrays the life of either a musician or a famous performer of the monomane (模倣?, \"imitation\") style of Japanese theatre. The object is to earn popularity while performing concert tours through the fictional city. Celebrity challenges are included in the game; they are considered to be miniature games like swimming and kicking a giant ball into a goal in a manner similar to soccer. While these games are fun to play, losing results in a loss of popularity points similar to performing terribly at a concert.\r\n\r\nAppeasing senior citizens by performing gigs at the nursing home is another way to gain popularity. Otherwise, they will criticize the player's music or theatre styles without an end. After gaining the respect of the elderly, the mad faces eventually turn into frowns (and eventually smiles). Television appearances come in the form of talent shows, televised concerts, and several other surprises. The eventual goal is to convert all stadiums and concert venues to the player's colors. In addition to popularity meters for the players, music styles have their own popularity meters. Smiles with the player's colors determine which music styles are best liked by the player's fans. This determine what music or theatre styles to play and which ones to avoid in certain concert venues.\r\n\r\nIn the talent contest, the show is like a tournament where four people compete in a semi-final format. After the judges give their score, the two players with the lowest score are eliminated. The players with the highest score end up competing in a final round where the highest scoring player is the winner and receives popularity points. During the actual performance, the player must choose his or her musical style(s) and must improvise the lyrics. During a televised concert, the game proceeds like in a normal concert. The only difference is that an increased number of popularity points are rewarded for a successful concert.\r\n\r\nWhen the player draws a certain combination on the dice, he or she must go to a nursing home and impress a grandmother with his or her musical or theatre styles. If the player can impress the grandmother with his or her music, then the player is accepted more by the elderly people. However, the elderly people can get grumpy again if the player manages to make the grandmother angry each time that the player has to perform at the nursing home again. All the text in the game is in Japanese. Other combinations of the letter and number dice can create or ruin a player's popularity along with other side effects.\r\n\r\nThe dice combination \"A-1\" is the best combination and it causes a rapid rise in popularity, which means more fans show up to the lucky person's concerts. Getting an \"F-5\" is the worst combination and will result in a loss of popularity. However, all other combinations can have either negative, neutral, or positive results for the player. Guessing about the result of the dice throw is all the fun of trying to get popularity for the band and greater appreciation from different age groups.","Genres":{"genre":"Life Simulation"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Pack-In-Video","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/40435-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"282","height":"400","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/40435-1.jpg"}}}},"Bakushou!!

Each side is represented by a craft called a \"rotofoil\", which can be controlled by either a human player or a computer-controlled \"droid\" with ten levels of difficulty. (The game allows for human vs. human, human vs. droid, and droid vs. droid matches.) The basic objective of the game is to score points by either firing or carrying a floating ball into the opponent's goal. The game takes place on a flat, checkerboard playfield, and each player's half of the screen is presented in a first-person perspective.\r\n\r\nA player can gain possession of the ball by simply running into it, at which point it is held in a force field in front of the craft. The opponent can attempt to knock the ball away from the player using the fire button, and the player in possession of the ball can also fire the ball toward the goal. When a player does not have possession of the ball, his or her rotofoil automatically turns at 90-degree intervals to face the ball, while possessing the ball turns the player toward the opponent's goal. The goalposts move from side to side at each end of the playfield, and as goals are scored, the goal becomes narrower.\r\n\r\nPushing the ball through the goal scores one point, firing the ball through the posts from close range scores two points, and successfully scoring from long range (where the goalposts are not visible) scores three points. The maximum number of total points between the two players is ten, meaning that any points scored that would take the combined total above ten will cause the opponent's score to be reduced by the same amount, resulting in a kind of tug of war scoring system. The game ends when either a player successfully scores ten points or the timer runs out. If time runs out and the score is tied, the game goes into \"sudden death\", where the first player to score wins.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","Developer":"Lucasfilm Games","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"6","Game":[{"id":"28824","PlatformId":"4914"},{"id":"5129","PlatformId":"26"},{"id":"4893","PlatformId":"27"},{"id":"29850","PlatformId":"30"},{"id":"6695","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"36720","PlatformId":"4929"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/26454-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"422","height":"289","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/26454-1.jpg"}}}},"Balloon Fight":{"id":"333","GameTitle":"Balloon Fight","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"01/02/1985","Overview":"The player controls the unnamed Balloon Fighter with two balloons attached to his back.

A less cartoony console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year.  Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992.  Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form.  Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams' players.  Enhanced pitch control.  Ability to shift field formations when playing defense.  Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game.  Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired.  Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.)  Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting.  Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each.  New music and home run animations. These include the \"Power connect\" graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation.  Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams.  You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5.  Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum.  You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples 'STAR 5', 'ROOK 2', etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name.  Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves. (A peculiar glitch occurs when viewing league leaders. The last pitcher listed on any user-created team in \"View Team\" does not appear in any of the Top 10 leaderboards.)","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Romstar","Developer":"Eikichi Kawasaki and team","Rating":"8","Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/7816-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/7816-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/7816-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1533","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/7816-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/7816-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1539","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/7816-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/7816-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/7816-1.jpg"},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/7816.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"165"}}}},"Bases Loaded":{"id":"1032","GameTitle":"Bases Loaded","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"06/26/1987","Overview":"The game allows the player to control one of 12 teams in either a single game or a full season.

The show also often used sound effects for the actions of not only Bigfoot, but others as well.  The gameplay involves racing monster trucks including the title truck, Bigfoot (blue). The computer controlled trucks are green (The Growler) and yellow (The Charger) if the computer's truck runs out of money and cannot repair their rig.  It was not uncommon for a skilled player to be challenged by three to four different monster trucks during the game.  In two player mode the 2nd player's truck is red.  The object of the game is to advance to the next level (race) with incurring the least amount of damage as possible.  The levels consist of car crushing, mud bog, tractor pull, hill climb and the later levels are a combination of everything except the sled pull, simply called a drag race.  To advance to the next event the player must complete a \"cross country\" race collecting money, points, etc. without damaging the truck.","Genres":{"genre":"Racing"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Acclaim","Developer":"Beam Software Company, Ltd.","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"37792","PlatformId":"4953"}},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1647-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1647-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1647-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1575","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1647-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1647-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1539","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1647-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1647-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1647-1.jpg"}}},"Bikkuriman World - Gekitou Sei Senshi":{"id":"26575","GameTitle":"Bikkuriman World: Gekitou Sei Senshi","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"07/27/1992","Overview":"Bikkuriman World: Gekitou Sei Senshi is a Role-Playing game, developed by Atlus and published by Hudson, which was released in Japan in 1990.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Hudson","Developer":"Atlus","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/26575-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"285","height":"400","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/26575-1.jpg"}}}},"Bill & Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure":{"id":"1648","GameTitle":"Bill & Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1990","Overview":"Bill & Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure is an action-adventure video game that is part of the Bill & Ted franchise and is based on the film Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure that was released in North America by LJN for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991.

They are informed that time-space rebels have gone back in time, kidnapping various historical figures and leaving them stranded in different time periods.  So now they must travel to the time periods, retrieve these figures and return them to their correct time periods.  This must be done as soon as possible; for if history isn't made right, the boys will miss the big concert that will launch Wyld Stallyns' music career.  Unfortunately, Rufus can only loan out a pay phonebooth for this trip.  Once the mission is explained, Ted leaves and Bill arrives later.  Rufus states that since they both came alone, it's best that they work separately.  From there Bill is brought up to speed on the situation.  Bill is instructed to go back in time and leave items to help Ted along the way in each time period he visits.  When Bill has done this he will start his own search.

In the MS-DOS version, the championship consisted of a visit to each of the eight tracks.  In the NES and Game Boy versions, the season championship consisted of each of the four tracks run twice, for a total of eight races.  Championship points were awarded consistent to the real-life Winston Cup of the time.  Both the MS-DOS and Nintendo versions allowed the player to setup the car, with effects to be seen.  Both of those versions also allowed the player to choose whether they would race with the effect of damage on their car or not.

These penguins move in mirror images of each other. The game features many different stages. After completing the 17th stage, players have to start over again on stage 1. \"Je te veux\" by Erik Satie is the background music in the game during the levels. Upon uniting the two penguins, Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" is played.\r\n\r\nA top-down view is utilized in the game; similar to the method used in The Adventures of Lolo.

With each level arranged on a 10-by-15 grid and a vertical wall separating the two penguins from each other, only the upper central cell is free for both characters to reach. This \"free cell\" always holds the caged heart that is required to complete the level. A row of walls surrounding each player in a maze-like environment.

In addition to those options, a CPU vs CPU mode and a CPU vs CPU quick mode are available in order to quicken up a tournament; the purpose is to see the stats of that particular match and quickly end tournaments.  The game uses city names but not the team names because of not having any proper licensing with Major League Baseball.  However, the players are purely fictional and they cannot be edited.  Some of the player names are parodies of real life baseball players (such as Baltimore's \"Kenrip\" being a not-so-subtle parody of Cal Ripken).

Vs Mode is a 2-player mode, while Battle Mode is a 3-player mode. The objective is to kill the opposing Bomberman by planting bombs.

Bonk's mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur).  In the Arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself.  Bonk attacks enemies by \"bonking\" them with his large, invincible forehead.  Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage and three extra lives.  Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.  Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger.  There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable.  Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat.  The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time.  A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power but will eventually decay into the first stage of meat power, and then back into regular Bonk.  Eating a small meat while in stage two will put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power.  And eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.  Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart which restores all of Bonk's missing health.  There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.  Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air.  Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small \"smiley\" power-up.  Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage.  The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.","Genres":{"genre":"Platform"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"NEC Home Electronics","Developer":"Red Company, Atlus","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"32738","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"18322","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"3777","PlatformId":"34"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1654-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1654-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1654-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1533","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1654-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1654-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1539","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1654-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1654-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1654-1.jpg"},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/1654.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"204"}}}},"Bonza":{},"Booby Kids":{"id":"26351","GameTitle":"Booby Kids","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"07/10/1987","Overview":"During the prehistoric era of humanity, cavemen and dinosaurs compete for ultimate supremacy.

Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGbhhqwRKAc","Publisher":"Data East","Developer":"Data East","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"7","Game":[{"id":"31868","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"7610","PlatformId":"22"},{"id":"10266","PlatformId":"31"},{"id":"10355","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"4060","PlatformId":"32"},{"id":"28882","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"37785","PlatformId":"4953"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/205-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/205-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/205-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1532","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/205-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/205-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1534","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/205-1.jpg"}}],"banner":[{"_":"graphical/205-g.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},{"_":"graphical/205-g2.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}}],"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/205-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/205-1.jpg"},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/205.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"174"}}}},"Business Wars":{"id":"40444","GameTitle":"Business Wars","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"01/24/1992","Overview":"Business Wars is an Adventure game, developed and published by Hect, which was released in Japan in 1992.","Genres":{"genre":"Adventure"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Hect","Developer":"Hect","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/40444-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"200","height":"317","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/40444-1.jpg"}}}},"Bust-a-Nut 04-11-11 (PD)":{},"C64Play Parallax Music Demo by Chris Covell (PD)":{},"C64Play Rambo Music Demo by Chris Covell (PD)":{},"CHR Shrink (PD)":{},"CMC 80's Demo by Chris Covell (PD)":{},"CMC DCEVO Dep04 Intro by Chris Covell (PD)":{},"CMC Wavy Demo by Chris Covell (PD)":{},"CPU Timing Test by Shay Green (09-14-2006) (PD)":{},"CPU Timing Test by Shay Green (09-19-2006) (PD)":{},"CPU Timing Test by Shay Green (09-20-2006) (PD)":{},"CPUtime (PD)":{},"Cabal":{"id":"1660","GameTitle":"Cabal","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1989","Overview":"The player assumes the role of an unnamed commando trying to destroy several enemy military bases. The player's character is seen from behind and initially starts behind a protective wall (the wall can get damaged and shattered by enemy fire). The player must use a limitless ammunition gun and a limited number of grenades to fend off enemy troops and damage the base. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structures (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies. (A feature criticised by many players. It can be circumvented, however, if two players play simultaneously and at least one stays alive at a given moment.)\r\nPower-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen. Some power-ups give special weapons: One of them is an extremely fast machinegun and other one is an automatic shotgun with a slightly lower firing rate, but has a larger crosshair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot. Others grant extra grenades or additional points.\r\nTwo players could play this game, cooperatively, simultaneously.\r\nThe arcade cabinet is a standard upright. Each player uses a trackball to move the player from side to side, and move the crosshairs about the screen. On later board revisions, a joystick was installed instead with an optional sub-pcb for use with a trackball. With a trackball, rolling (an invincible movement during which the player could not attack) is done by pushing the trackball to maximum speed.","Genres":{"genre":"Shooter"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"Yes","Publisher":"Milton Bradley Company","Developer":"Zippo Games","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"41927","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"26209","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"6714","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"35361","PlatformId":"4913"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1660-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1660-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1660-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1502","height":"2095","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1660-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1660-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1529","height":"2098","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1660-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1660-1.jpg","$":{"width":"480","height":"360"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1660-1.jpg"},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/1660.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"187"}}}},"Cadillac":{"id":"26580","GameTitle":"Cadillac","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"02/02/1990","Overview":"Cadillac is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by Hect, which was released in Japan in 1990.","Genres":{"genre":"Strategy"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Hect","Developer":"Hect","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/26580-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"271","height":"380","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/26580-1.jpg"}}}},"Caesars Palace":{"id":"1661","GameTitle":"Caesars Palace","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"12/01/1992","Overview":"This game allows you to play in the Caesars Palace casino.

To prove that she has visited a particular location, she must drive around the location painting every section of the road white. However, the police, who have no tolerance for vandalism, attempt to stop the driver from completing her goal. The player's car can jump and fire cans of oil. To avoid forcing the player from retracing the same roads again, the roads change color when the car drives over them, indicating that that specific road has been painted. There are three main obstacles: police, cats and spikes. The police chase after the car and if a police car comes into contact with the main character's car, the car \"explodes\" by turning into a group of hearts and the player loses a life. To combat this, the player can obtain cans of oil, which can be used to cause the police cars to spin out of control, allowing the player to bump them off the screen. Other enemies include a cat, which, when hit, causes the player to lose an extra life as the cat goes diagonally off the screen (but does not cause the car to \"explode\") with playing of a comical music, \"Der Flohwalzer\", known as \"Neko Funjatta\" (I Stepped on the Cat) in Japan. There is also spikes, which make the car \"explode\" on contact. Occasionally, a balloon may float by during any given stage. If the car touches one of these balloons, it collects it and collecting three such balloons will activate a warp that sends the car multiple stages ahead and provides significant bonus points. Although the city you travel to will change, the difficulty pattern of the road will remain the same. As the number of cities you travel to loop endlessly, the game is not shortened by taking a warp. One particular thing about this game is the \"catchy\" tune that plays in the background as you enter a new city. Although it uses \"ethnic\" variations according to the destination, it's an adaptation of a famous classic piece, \"Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso\", from Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1.","Genres":{"genre":["Platform","Racing"]},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Jaleco / Kitcorp","Developer":"Axes Art Amuse","Rating":"7.5","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"38791","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"36502","PlatformId":"4929"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1674-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1674-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1674-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1536","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1674-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1674-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1539","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1674-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1674-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1674-1.jpg"}}},"Clash at Demonhead":{"id":"1250","GameTitle":"Clash at Demonhead","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"01/27/1989","Overview":"Clash at Demonhead is an open-ended platformer.

The bosses are a sea serpent (as seen on the cover), a giant crab, a giant squid, a red and black version of the sea serpent and a giant shark. The game uses a powerup bar similar to the Gradius series. Powerup pods are collected to move the selector to different powerup items. When the desired powerup is highlighted, the player can select it, after which the menu returns to an unhighlighted state. Menu options are \"Turbo\" (increase the speed of the boat), \"Fire\" (increase the number of bullets the primary gun fires), \"Speed\" (increase speed of shots and rate of fire), \"Missile\" (improves missiles) and \"Force\" (a force field around the boat plus replenished health). The speed boat used for game play starts with a single gun which can be upgraded to a quadruple spread shot. Missiles can also be added to the boat's arsenal and can be upgraded to heat-seekers. Between stages which are not connected by water, the Cobra Class has a helicopter style propeller that extends from the roof of the cabin. However, this flying state of the boat is never used in gameplay. The boat has a 12-point damage bar which can be reduced by contact with obstacles or enemy fire.","Genres":{"genre":"Racing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Nintendo","Developer":"Rare","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1677-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1540","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1677-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1677-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1528","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1677-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1677-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1677-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1677-2.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1677-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1677-3.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1677-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1677-4.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1677-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1677-5.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1677-5.jpg"}]}},"Cocoron":{"id":"23560","GameTitle":"Cocoron","AlternateTitles":{"title":"ココロン"},"PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"05/03/1991","Overview":"Tapir, an enigmatic blue wizard in spotted pajamas from the Dream World, sends the player on a quest to rescue princess Rua.

There were typically 1 - 3 enemies on screen at once, appearing out of a trapdoor in the top corners, or let in through the side walls. Every few levels there was also a boss, ranging from a small dragon to a centipede. The bosses changed colour from Green to Blue to Pink, each time increasing in speed. Each level also contained a hidden letter which made up a password presented at the end of the game (Zone 4 Level 11). If this was not input correctly, the player restarted the game from the beginning.

After being humiliated once again by his rival, Jeff \"Crash\" Cooney and his blue-collar buddies from Southside High School at the All-City Track Meet, he has decided to issue a challenge to Crash. Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers. Thus, a four player adapter is not required, unlike other Kunio-kun games.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"4+","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Technos Japan","Developer":"Technos Japan","Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/7828-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/7828-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/7828-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"366","height":"519","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/7828-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/7828-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"496","height":"680","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/7828-1.png"}}],"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/7828-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/7828-1.jpg"}}},"Crayon Shin-Chan":{},"Crayon Shin-Chan - Ora to Poi Poi":{"id":"26594","GameTitle":"Crayon Shin-Chan: Ora to Poi Poi","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"08/27/1993","Overview":"The game is a simple card game with a Tetris element.

The window onto which it drops the climber may be about to close. If the window that the climber is dropped onto is fully closed, the balloon pauses there until the window opens up again. The player does not actually earn bonus points for catching the balloon, but he is awarded the normal 'step value' for each of the eight floors that he passes while holding the balloon.\r\n\r\nIf the climber is able to ascend to the top of a skyscraper and grabs the runner of a waiting helicopter, he earns a bonus and is transported to another skyscraper, which presents more dangers than the past. The helicopter would only wait about 30 seconds, then fly off.\r\n\r\nIf the player completes all four skyscrapers, he is taken back to the first skyscraper and the game restarts from the beginning, but the player keeps his score.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Nichibutsu","Developer":"Nihon Bussan","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"29763","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"8352","PlatformId":"22"},{"id":"19547","PlatformId":"4925"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/26595-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"293","height":"158","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/26595-1.jpg"}}}},"Creatom":{},"Crime Busters":{"id":"37011","GameTitle":"Crime Busters","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1989","Overview":"Crime Busters is an Action game, developed and published by Bit Corp., which was released in Asia in 1989.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P127Oqm7vA","Publisher":"Bit Corp.","Developer":"Bit Corp.","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/37011-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"256","height":"224","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/37011-1.png"}}}},"Crisis Force":{"id":"22443","GameTitle":"Crisis Force","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"08/27/1991","Overview":"The denizens of Atlantis have arisen after a slumber of 10,000 years, and only Asuka and Maya can save the world from destruction in their Aurawing aircraft!

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from \"cool\" to \"warm\", \"hot\", and \"critical\" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to \"cool\" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.\r\nThe standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well.\r\nThe standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.\r\nCyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. It has also been ported to numerous other platforms, including the Commodore Amiga, Atari Lynx and Sega Genesis.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Atari Games","Developer":"Atari Games","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"7835","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"4326","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"27979","PlatformId":"36"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1684-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"371","height":"522","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1684-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1684-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"350","height":"495","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1684-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1684-1.jpg","$":{"width":"480","height":"360"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1684-1.jpg"},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/1684.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"175"}}}},"Cybernoid - The Fighting Machine":{"id":"1685","GameTitle":"Cybernoid: The Fighting Machine","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1989","Overview":"In Cybernoid, pirates have raided the storage depots of the Federation and stolen minerals, jewels, ammunition and the latest battle weaponry.

Deep Dungeon III: The Journey to the Hero) is the third installment in the Deep Dungeon series and the first to be released on the Famicom. This is the first Deep Dungeon title to offer the player a world to explore spanning multiple dungeons and multiple towns. It also allows the player to create their own party with up to three companions in addition to the hero character, with a choice of ranger, magician or priest for each character. Though the player can dismiss a character once the game has started, they will only be able to replace that character if they meet another pre-created playable character in one of the dungeons. However, the game will still end as soon as the protagonist \"swordsman\" character is defeated. This game retains the player-adjustable level-up stats from the first game, as well as the feature that removes randomized encounters if the player is at a significantly higher experience level than needed for their current location. One exclusive and rather annoying feature of this game engine is that sometimes the player character will fumble (remove) their equipped weapon, wasting that character's turn. If the player wishes to re-arm their weapon, it will cost the player another turn. This is the only game in the series to award the player money (Gold) when defeating enemies. All other games will force the player to re-enter maps to collect respawning chests for money or items (for resale) if they want to gold farm.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Square","Developer":"HummingBirdSoft","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/26765-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"579","height":"800","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/26765-1.jpg"}}}},"Deep Dungeon IV - Kuro no Youjutsushi":{"id":"26766","GameTitle":"Deep Dungeon IV: Kuro no Youjutsushi","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"04/06/1990","Overview":"Deep Dungeon IV: Kuro no Yōjutsushi (ディープダンジョンIV 黒の妖術師?, lit.

Through the game, the player will meet up to two additional playable characters with predetermined class. This game also reverts to the standard practice or randomizing characters' stat growth when gaining an experience level. New to this engine is that the player can eventually learn to summon two monsters to function as a temporary additional party member for a single battle. It also removed the feature that stops random battles when the player is significantly more powerful than the enemies. This isn't as bad as it seems as the maps in this game are also much smaller (whereas the previous games used multi-floor dungeons up to 32x32 tiles, the dungeons in this game are either single floor, or multiple floors that can fit within a single 32x32 map) In this game, the player can accept \"requests\" from the non-player characters.

Each scenario gives a different set number of units to use, which the player can mix and match between the different typese without going over that limit. When in a one-player game, the second controller can be used to modify the CPU forces. When playing against the CPU, the computer will be given a different ratio of units to command than the player. On the easiest scenario both the player and the CPU have the same amount of units, on all others the CPU will have more than the player. There is no variance in artificial intelligence, so the only thing that makes the later maps harder is the larger number of units the CPU has. The game is turn-based with no time limit. The object of the game is to destroy the enemy's headquarters unit. The player that does so first wins. Units have different mobility range, which varies according to the unit type and (except for aircraft) the terrain. They also have different shooting range, though this is fixed and not depends of the terrain. All unit types have limited ammunition and fuel. In order to replenish them the player must land them at the appropiate buildings; for example, all aircraft must stop at an airport in order to recharge their fuel and ammo supply.

In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor. At the start of the game, the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as submachine guns, explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However, bullets have minimal range, only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane's health, which is drained by bullet wounds, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost. The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fifth level. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game's final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans and any of the 40 terrorists left alive. One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However, after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the \"foot meter\". The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits. The game features cinematic sequences which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example, if there is fewer than one minute left and the player defeats Karl, the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the helicopter sent by Hans.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Activision","Developer":"Pack-In-Video","Rating":"4","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"27066","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"25281","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"23276","PlatformId":"34"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1695-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1695-2.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1695-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1540","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1695-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1695-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1526","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1695-1.jpg"}}],"banner":{"_":"graphical/1695-g.png","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1695-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1695-1.jpg"}}},"Difference":{},"Dig Dug":{"id":"16994","GameTitle":"Dig Dug","AlternateTitles":{"title":["DigDug","Dig Dug (Japan)"]},"PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"04/19/1982","Overview":"Dig a little deeper into this thrilling action game as Dig Dug!

The second World is a shooter game that scrolls automatically in both horizontal and vertical directions. The third World is an underwater adventure game where each screen scrolls over to the next like in the original Zelda game.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"40947","PlatformId":"4966"}},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/26775-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/26775-1.jpg"},"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/26775-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"280","height":"403","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/26775-1.jpg"}}}},"Doraemon - Giga Zombie no Gyakushuu":{"id":"26776","GameTitle":"Doraemon: Giga Zombie no Gyakushuu","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"09/14/1990","Overview":"Doraemon: Giga Zombie no Gyakushū (ドラえもん ギガゾンビの逆襲 Doraemon Giga Zonbii no Gyakushū?, lit.

Rounds one and two were 10-question trivia rounds, each of which started with a toss-up challenge. Round three – the obstacle course – featured eight stages to be completed within 60 seconds. Toss-up challenges determined which team got initial control of the trivia round. To complete a toss-up, each player had to determine the precise speed and angle of whatever object they were throwing to hit a target.  Physical challenges were played the same way. All questions were multiple choice, and each player could use the up or down arrows on the controller to make his selection. Three possible answers and either a dare, double dare, or physical challenge option were offered. The player confirmed his selection by pressing the A button. Confirming a dare doubled the base dollar value of the question; a double dare quadrupled the base dollar value. The player with the most money at the end of round two went on to the obstacle course. In order to move through an obstacle, the player had to repeatedly alternate between pressing either the left and right or up and down arrows on the controller's D-pad. In order to grab the flag, the player had to position the on-screen contestant in just the right spot and then press the A button to jump and retrieve it. Some found it easier to get through the course by using the NES Advantage, a joystick controller, rather than the NES' standard controller. The obstacles are all based on real obstacles from the show (with one exception) and are randomized before a game. They include The Tank, The 1-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, The Fireman's Flagpole, The Monkey Bars, \"Dallas\", Mount St. Double Dare, Moonwalk, and an original obstacle designed like a triangular jungle gym. \"Prizes\" for beating the obstacle course included a BMX bicycle, television set, an NES console, and several other gifts, ending with a exotic vacation -- though it can prove very difficult to get the best \"ending\" by completing the last obstacle. The obstacle course's flag colour depended on which team was playing, if blue, the flags were blue, and if red, the flags were red.","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"GameTek","Developer":"Rare","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1698-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"360","height":"513","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1698-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1698-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"350","height":"495","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1698-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1698-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1698-1.jpg"}}},"Double Dragon":{"id":"208","GameTitle":"Double Dragon","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1987","Overview":"Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers who learned to fight on the cold, tough streets of the city.

When word reached the monk that King Lawrence's 16-year-old daughter Celia had been abducted and held by a fearsome dragon, who wished to break the kingdom's spirit and coerce the kingdom to do his bidding, Clovis felt a sense of duty to chase after the dragon and rescue Celia in the name of his father.

The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series.\r\nDragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles.\r\nThe remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting \"Tidy Item\" and \"Tidy Bag\" commands; and the \"Full HP\" command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells.\r\nWhile the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another \"major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.\"","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Enix","Developer":"Enix","Rating":"5.3333","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"8614","PlatformId":"41"}},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1700-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1700-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1700-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1535","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1700-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1700-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"350","height":"495","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1700-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1700-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1700-1.jpg"}}},"Dragon Warrior IV":{"id":"1275","GameTitle":"Dragon Warrior IV","AlternateTitles":{"title":"Dragon Quest IV"},"PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"10/12/1992","Overview":"Dragon Quest IV differs from the rest of the series by breaking up the game into five distinct chapters, each of which focuses on a different protagonist or protagonists.

With these winnings they can repair or upgrade various components of the hydroplane to improve racing performance and remain competitive in the increasingly-difficult races. Eliminator Boat Duel offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Completing a race at a lower difficulty level advances the player to the next higher one. At each difficulty level, the player's hydroplane can be damaged from impact with animals, the opponent's hydroplane, and various stationary objects. A false start is penalized with a $2,000 fine. For most of a race, players control their hydroplanes from a bird's-eye view, and the screen scrolls in multiple directions; but in one segment of the race, the graphical perspective changes to a third-person tracking mode. In a single-player game, the player competes first with Seasick Sidney (in Easy mode), with Aquarius Rex (in Normal mode), or with Surfer Bob (in Expert mode). The player then competes against Vicious Vicky, Weird Willy, Mangler Mike, Veronica Alabaster, and Disaster Don (the reigning World Champion), respectively. To win, the player must defeat each opponent one-against-one on three unique race courses.

It is a fairytale-inspired menu-driven adventure game. Players use the menu commands to interact with the world: moving around, looking around, picking up objects, talking to people, etc. The setting of this game is 20th century Japan.\r\n\r\nIn a novel twist, the two characters of Erika and Satoru (who are depicted as twin schoolchildren) are independently playable - either a single player switches between the two, or a second player takes over the second twin. Both characters need to be in the same region to converse with NPCs, but are otherwise free to explore the map autonomously. Two-player adventure games are very rare; even in Japan. However, only one person can partake in the animal quiz portion. Failing the quiz will force the player(s) to start from the beginning.\r\n\r\nAn odd bit of infamy related to this game is a secret developer's message that can be found if the player inputs a list of button presses after waiting some time after the game ends. Inside of which is a litany of compliments and complaints to other co-workers, including some sexual insults which are deeply at odds with the child-friendly nature of the game.

Though a more evil player has stronger abilities, players must air on the side of good in order to make significant advances through the game.\r\n\r\nAs a result, this game is considered extremely difficult, due to the unknown nature of how one should behave in order to proceed. If the player does not perform the correct actions, levels typically repeat themselves, and players find themselves stuck in the game with no clear method to advance.

After a level is completed, the player must answer five multiple choice bible-related questions before advancing to the next level. After answering enough questions correctly, the player is rewarded with an extra life. Exodus, like many Wisdom Tree games, is a modified version of a Color Dreams game, in this case Crystal Mines.

During each turn, the player is given a certain amount of funds which can be used to build units in factories, seaports, and airports in their command, as well as cities near their headquarters. Each unit has their own specialty and abilities, with ten land units (including two foot soldier units), four air units, and two sea units. Some units use firepower against the enemy, while others provide support to allies. Only foot soldier units are capable of conquering cities, which are used to repair or refuel damaged units and gain more funds.

One or two players could play.\r\nJust like the show, the object was to come up with answers to survey questions posed to 100 people. Correct answers were worth money, with $200 winning the game and the right to play Fast Money for $5,000, which was played exactly the same way as on the show (at least 200 points needed to win). $5 a point was awarded for unsuccessful playings of the round.\r\nA player entered his answers by using the controller to scroll through the alphabet, contained in a string along the bottom of the screen; the answer had to be completed within a time limit. Reasonable similies to correct answers were accepted, and slight misspellings were also recognized.\r\nOnce a player won, they were given two options. The first was to stop playing, with the other being to continue on. A champion retired after winning over $20,000 automatically unless they were defeated.\r\nIf a computer-controlled family wins the game, no Fast Money is played with an excuse given to the form of \"Due to (EXCUSE), the (NAMES) will not be playing Fast Money today\".

It was one of the few 8-bit Formula One video games to adequately represent the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve as having an urban background along with several other urban race tracks represented in the 1992 Formula One season. Tire wear is possible resulting in trips to the pit crew for maintenance and repairs. A radio allows communication with the crew chief; he will advise whether repairs are necessary. The top speed of the vehicle is 325 kilometres per hour and turbo is not used in the game.\r\nBefore the first qualifying session can take place, the player must insert his name and his nationality. The name can be up to 10 characters long and the country has to fit into a three-character field. Since the game doesn't verify if the three-letter code matches up to a real nationality, it doesn't matter if the player makes up a nationality for a fictional country.","Genres":{"genre":"Racing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Acclaim","Developer":"System 3","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"18631","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"479","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"27995","PlatformId":"36"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/7864-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"500","height":"687","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/7864-1.jpg"}}}},"Fester's Quest":{"id":"1284","GameTitle":"Fester's Quest","AlternateTitles":{"title":["The Addams Family: Fester's Quest","Fester's Quest","Uncle Fester's Quest","Uncle","Fester"]},"PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"09/13/1989","Overview":"It's just a kidnapping.

The Family Computer version of Field Combat was later released for the Wii's Virtual Console service exclusively in Japan on June 12, 2007.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to make it all the way to the end of the battlefield using the Genesis; a warship that can fire off missiles. While the player controls the blue forces, the player must defeat the Red forces without dying in the process by either avoiding or shooting helicopters, infantrymen, and tanks. An interesting characteristic of the game is that it is possible to ask for reinforcements from an army, which the player possesses, by pressing both the A and B buttons at the same time. Whenever the player runs out of units to aid him in battle, he can use his special weapon to \"absorb\" the enemies and add them to his army.\r\n\r\nThe game used Richard Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries as its background music. There is also an enemy UFO like spaceship that, when in battlefield, attempts to grab and escape with a player friendly unit (if there is any on the battlefield).It will also engage into air-to-air battle with a friendly helicopter (if there is any).","Genres":{"genre":"Shooter"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Jaleco","Developer":"TOSE","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/21494-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"362","height":"251","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/21494-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/21494-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"384","height":"266","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/21494-1.jpg"}}]}},"Fighting Hero":{"id":"26465","GameTitle":"Fighting Hero","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1991","Overview":"Fighting Hero is an unlicensed fighting game, based off Street Fighter.","Genres":{"genre":"Fighting"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"NTDEC","Developer":"Mega Soft","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/26465-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"600","height":"852","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/26465-1.jpg"}}}},"Fighting Hero III":{"id":"26468","GameTitle":"Fighting Hero III","AlternateTitles":{"title":"Fighting Hero 3"},"PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1993","Overview":"Fighting Hero III is a fighting game, created by NTDEC and released in 1993.

It is the first naval battle game ever released for the system. While it supposedly depicts a battle between two fictional countries, the game is largely recognized to be a recreation of one of the crucial naval battles that occurred between Japan and the United States near the end of World War II. Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers, battleships, submarines and aircraft carriers.\r\n\r\nA couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map using the plastic models.

Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan No Sho, or Book of the Mind's Eye which Juan had managed to save.

Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\" as a representative of Shorinji.

After learning from Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls, he leaves for the World Tournament. There are two different types of gameplay. Journey levels are side-scrolling levels where Ryuhi must defeat five bosses and find certain items valuable to the mission.

The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.\r\nGalaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's \"hit/miss ratio\" at the end of the game, and a bonus \"Challenging Stage\" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy.\r\nAnother gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a \"boss Galaga\" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large.\r\nGalaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous \"Split-Screen bug\" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game \"rolls over\" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.","Genres":{"genre":"Shooter"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Midway","Developer":"Namco","Rating":"6.6667","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"7861","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"4899","PlatformId":"27"},{"id":"35838","PlatformId":"4929"}]},"Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1834-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1834-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1834-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1834-2.jpg"}],"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1834-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1536","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1834-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1834-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1527","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1834-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1834-1.jpg","$":{"width":"480","height":"360"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1834-1.jpg"},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/1834.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"193"}}}},"Galaxian":{"id":"25378","GameTitle":"Galaxian","AlternateTitles":{"title":"ギャラクシアン"},"PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"09/07/1984","Overview":"The Galaxian Fleet has invaded and it's up to you to stop them.

Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Yokai Army) is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong. The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and yōkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller.\r\n\r\nGegege no Kitarou 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points.\r\n\r\nThe map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Bandai","Developer":"Bandai","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/26888-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"299","height":"210","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/26888-1.jpg"}}}},"Geimos":{"id":"26889","GameTitle":"Geimos","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"08/28/1985","Overview":"Geimos (ゲイモス Gei Mohss?) is a third-person shoot 'em up video game for the Nintendo Family Computer.\r\n\r\nThis game is playing according to the traditional strategies of Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom where players have to destroy towers, alien starships, and tanks with the player's own starship along the surface of a planet with a selection of different space backdrops in the background.

The goal is to line up five pieces in a row.\r\n\r\nGomoku Narabe Renju is a video game simulation of a traditional Eastern board game that uses the board and pieces from the popular board game Go. It plays a lot like the American board game Connect Four, in which the goal is to line up a series of five tiles horizontally, vertically or diagonally before the other player can do the same. Two players take it in turns to place a single Go tile on the board, attempting to craft their own lines while strategically placing tiles that blocks the opponent from finishing theirs.\r\n\r\nWhile the normal board game is simply referred to as \"Gomoku Narabe\" (Five Pieces in a Row, occasionally translated as Gobang), the Renju modifier is an additional rule that makes it harder for the player with the black pieces to win. Because the black player always begins each game (like how the white player always begins each game of Chess), this additional rule is thought to even the playing field. The rule is that the black player will lose if they build a line of six or more pieces: this counts as going \"overlong\" and counts as a loss.\r\n\r\nGomoku Narabe Renju is the joint-fourth video game ever released on the Famicom, and the joint-first original game produced for the system (the previous three - Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Popeye - were all ports of Arcade games).

The Goonies from the PlayChoice-10 range.\r\n\r\nThe game was followed by a sequel that diverges from the movie's story and is better known to US audiences. The game is not to be confused with the 1985 Datasoft game for the C64, Atari 8-Bit and Spectrum which was closer to The Lost Vikings with its co-operative puzzles.\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\nThe game features Mikey as he runs around various stages based on locations from the movie - the closed restaurant that the Fratellis use as a hideout, the caverns beneath the restaurant and One-Eyed Willy's pirate ship - saving his friends and recovering keys. In order to progress, Mikey must find three keys and the captive Goonie on each stage. As well as bats, rats and other hostile wildlife, Mikey is being pursued by the three Fratelli family members: they cannot be defeated, but can be stunned temporarily.\r\n\r\nMikey can find power-ups that help him proceed. The most important of these are bombs which destroy walls marked by skulls and reveal keys and captive Goonies behind them. Permanent bonuses like headphones (which prevents Mikey being hurt by Jake Fratelli's opera singing) and a backpack (which allows Mikey to carry two bombs at once) can also be found, but only once and each in a specific stage.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Konami","Developer":"Konami","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"28295","PlatformId":"4914"},{"id":"27070","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"31622","PlatformId":"4929"},{"id":"23215","PlatformId":"1"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/41996-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"600","height":"413","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/41996-1.jpg"}}}},"Gorby no Pipeline Daisakusen":{"id":"26903","GameTitle":"Gorby no Pipeline Daisakusen","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"04/12/1991","Overview":"In this falling-block puzzle game, a small girl—wearing a Russian national costume of sarafan, kokoshnik, and valenki—pushes tiles representing segments of water pipe down a two-dimensional, vertical shaft; this shaft is the field of play.

If the player routes the water to a dead end, the game adds a layer of pipe segments for the player to clear. If the accumulating pipe segments stack to the top of the shaft, the game ends. By clearing the requisite number of rows, the player proceeds to the next game level.","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Tokuma Shoten","Developer":"Compile","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/26903-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"448","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/26903-1.jpg"}}}},"Gorilla Man, The":{},"Gotcha! - The Sport!":{"id":"1846","GameTitle":"Gotcha!

One day, together with a fellow sculptor Akanemaru, Gaou encountered a mythical phoenix, who, according to legend, can bestow eternal life to those who drink its blood. Inspired, Gaou devotes himself to the creation of a magnificent phoenix sculpture. However, shortly after finishing the sculpture, it was stolen from him, broken into 16 pieces, and hidden in different time periods of the past and the future.

It is a sequel to a 1984 arcade game developed by Capcom known as Pirate Ship Higemaru. Neither the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan, although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it was to be renamed \"Makai Island\".\r\n\r\nIn Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications.\r\n\r\nOnce Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key. The island exploration sections are extremely reminiscent of dungeon exploration aspects of The Legend of Zelda, to which the game is often compared to.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Capcom","Developer":"Capcom","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/26965-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"444","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/26965-1.jpg"}}}},"High Speed":{"id":"1854","GameTitle":"High Speed","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"04/28/1994","Overview":"The hottest pinball game ever has been converted to video!

In 2010 Naito was honored with the Order of the Rising Sun, twin Mitsuaki, the fifth highest honor a citizen can receive in Japan.\r\n\r\nHonshogi: Naitou Kudan Shogi Hiden, follows the standard rules of Shoji (Japanese Chess). There is no ability to change the difficulty or handicap. Most of the screen is the Shoji board, but there is also a representation of the player and computer playing Shoji in a Japanese setting, which moves as the game moves. The player always starts first, with the fastest possible way to beat the computer set at 15 hands/turns.\r\n\r\nHonshogi: Naitou Kudan Shogi Hiden was entered into the first annual World Computer Shoji Championship in 1990.

Players bounce a ball around a Mahjong table filled with concealed tiles, with their goal being to dislodge the tiles and collect the ones they wish to add to their hand by passing underneath them as they fall. The stage is over either after all the tiles have fallen or the player has a winning hand.\r\n\r\nThe block-breaking aspect is simple: Simply direct the bouncing ball by hitting it with the paddle to first destroy the wall of betting tokens before reaching the hidden tiles. Hitting a tile once reveals it, allowing the player to strategically direct the ball so that they can collect the tile (if desired) and still catch the ball before it leaves the screen.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are various power-ups that are mingled with the tiles. These have different characters than the dragons/seasons/flowers and provide different benefits, such as a partial wall to block the ball, forcefields that slow it down and special tiles that reveal all the remaining hidden tiles.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that as useful as a tile might be towards obtaining a winning hand, it is not worth losing the ball (and subsequently a life) over.\r\n\r\nMahjong can seem a little convoluted, but it plays essentially like the card game rummy: The goal is to collect and discard tiles until the player has a hand that is comprised of Chows (straights of three, worth nothing but easier to obtain), Pungs (three-of-a-kind) and Kongs (four-of-a-kind, worth more than Pungs). The player normally has thirteen tiles in a hand, though this becomes fourteen tiles when they're in the process of discarding one. If those fourteen tiles comprise of Chows, Pungs and Kongs (and one pair) then it is a winning hand and the holder can declare Mahjong to win the round.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this game, much of the game's rules are unnecessary, including betting or indeed any of the multiplayer aspects. The goal is to simply put together a winning hand by collecting the right tiles as they drop. Tiles can range from \"Characters\" (a black symbol over a red symbol, actually Chinese numerical symbols for thousands), \"Bamboo\" (green sticks) and \"Wheels\" (black and red circles), as well as the three dragons (the red and green characters and the blank white tiles), the four seasons and four flowers. With the exception of the seasons and flowers, players need three (or four) instances of the same tile to score points.","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"K Amusement Leasing","Developer":"Micronics","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/40537-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"441","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/40537-1.jpg"}}}},"Jordan Vs Bird - One On One":{"id":"2838","GameTitle":"Jordan Vs Bird: One on One","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"08/03/1989","Overview":"Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls and Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics were the only two players in the game, which allowed the player to participate in a one-on-one basketball game.

It uses the likeness of prolific Japanese professional golfer Masashi \"Jumbo\" Ozaki.\r\n\r\nHAL Laboratory, after creating many of Nintendo's golf games as a second party developer, decided to develop and publish their own golf title. Jumbo Ozaki no Hole in One Professional features the likeness of Japan's most prominent golf player, Masashi \"Jumbo\" Ozaki - the Jumbo nickname comes from his unusual height for a Japanese male: almost 6'. Though featured on the box art and in the title, Jumbo Ozaki makes no obvious appearance in-game.\r\n\r\nThough by all practical metrics a perfectly standard overhead golf simulator - players take it in turn to get the ball to the hole in as few shots as possible, selecting the direction, club used and power of each shot - the game does do things a little differently than usual. Specifically, the visual cue for the power of the shot comes from the depiction of the golfer himself: The player must monitor the character as he swings, hitting the button at both the apex and nadir of the swing for maximum effect. This replaces the usual sliding power bar that most golf games have. Failure to hit the swing precisely will lead to slices and hooks.\r\n\r\nThe game can be played as a single player Stroke Match, which allows the player to practice on each of the game's 36 holes across two different courses. The player can also play against another human, or rate their score against CPU opponents in the 1 Day and 4 Day modes. The player can also adjust the difficulty, which makes wind speed a much more important factor.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"HAL Laboratory","Developer":"HAL Laboratory","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/33250-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"350","height":"242","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/33250-1.jpg"}}}},"Jump-Jump":{},"Jumpin' Kid - Jack to Mame no Ki Monogatari":{"id":"27156","GameTitle":"Jumpin' Kid: Jack to Mame no Ki Monogatari","AlternateTitles":{"title":"ジャンピン・キッド ジャックと豆の木ものがたり"},"PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"12/19/1990","Overview":"The evil Giant has kidnapped Jack's girlfriend and now he must travel up the beanstalk and return to the Giant's castle in the sky to save her!

A sequel was released using a new game engine and new artwork (with some of the original art as well), entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition.

Gunjin Shogi: Nanya Sore!? is a shogi game that uses the gunjin shogi, or military shogi, variant of the classic eastern chess-like board game. The player starts by selecting one of five opponents: A pumpkin-headed ghost, a werewolf Al Capone, an alien, Adolf Hitler or a sumo wrestler. The player is then given an assortment of pieces while the opponent appears to have the same number of instances of the same piece, though in truth their real forms are concealed from the human player. The player must use their wits to defeat the enemy's force of shogi pieces, which have different themes depending on the opponent the player has chosen (for instance, when fighting the pumpkin ghost both sides have vegetable-themed pieces).\r\n\r\nWhen one of the player's pieces and an opponent's piece occupy the same space, a battle ensues: Some pieces will always win against other types, sort of like the rock-paper-scissors aspect of strategy games like Fire Emblem. If neither of the two pieces are weak to the other, both are eliminated. The goal is to figure out what pieces the opponent is attacking with and take them out - sometimes it is possible to ascertain what piece it is with how many spaces it can move, but the most reliable method is to see which pieces it is able to defeat, recalling its place on the rock-scissors-paper chain and then using a piece strong against it to finish it off.\r\n\r\nThe game, like all shogi simulators, was never released outside of Japan.","Genres":{"genre":"Strategy"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sofel","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/40539-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"300","height":"203","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/40539-1.jpg"}}}},"Kagerou Densetsu":{"id":"27159","GameTitle":"Kagerou Densetsu","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"05/11/1990","Overview":"Kagerou Densetsu is a Role-Playing game, developed by ITL and published by Pixel Multimedia, which was released in Japan in 1990.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Pixel Multimedia","Developer":"ITL","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27159-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"273","height":"392","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27159-1.jpg"}}}},"Kaguya Hime Densetsu":{"id":"27160","GameTitle":"Kaguya Hime Densetsu","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"12/16/1988","Overview":"Kaguya Hime Densetsu is an Adventure game, developed by Micronics and published by Victor Interactive Software, which was released in Japan in 1988.","Genres":{"genre":"Adventure"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Victor Interactive Software","Developer":"Micronics","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27160-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"295","height":"208","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27160-1.jpg"}}}},"Kaijuu Monogatari":{"id":"27161","GameTitle":"Kaijuu Monogatari","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"11/18/1988","Overview":"Kaijū Monogatari (貝獣物語?) is a role-playing video game developed by Birthday and published by Namco for Famicom, in November 1988 in Japan.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Namco","Developer":"Birthday","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27161-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"568","height":"812","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27161-1.jpg"}}}},"Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2 - Karakuri Land":{"id":"27162","GameTitle":"Kaiketsu Yancha Maru 2: Karakuri Land","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"08/30/1991","Overview":"Kaiketsu Yancha Maru 2: Karakuri Land is an Action game, developed and published by Irem, which was released in Japan in 1991.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Irem","Developer":"Irem","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27162-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"170","height":"241","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27162-1.jpg"}}}},"Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3 - Taiketsu!

To further its plans for world domination, Shocker recruited its agents through kidnapping, turning their victims into mutant cyborgs and, ultimately, brainwashing them. However, one victim named Takeshi Hongo escaped just before the final brainwashing. With his sanity and moral conscience intact, Hongo battled Shocker's minions as the grasshopper-themed altered human superhero Kamen Rider. Another of Shocker's victims, freelance photographer Hayato Ichimonji, had also been given cyborg implants, but was saved by Kamen Rider from the brainwashing process to become Kamen Rider #2. Assisted by motorcycle race team manager Tobei Tachibana and FBI agent Kazuya Taki, the Kamen Riders fought in both solo and partnered missions against both Shocker and its successor organization Gel-Shocker.","Genres":{"genre":["Platform","Role-Playing"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=https://8ZPGQvBtWIE","Publisher":"Bandai","Developer":"TOSE","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/18353-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"600","height":"413","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/18353-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/18353-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"592","height":"402","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/18353-1.jpg"}}]}},"Kamen Rider SD - Guranshokkaa no Yabou":{"id":"40540","GameTitle":"Kamen Rider SD: GranShocker no Yabou","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"01/22/1993","Overview":"Kamen Rider SD is a tokusatsu-themed board game., developed and published by Angel (Bandai), which was released in Japan in 1993.","Genres":{"genre":"Strategy"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Angel (Bandai)","Developer":"Angel (Bandai)","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/40540-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"439","height":"305","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/40540-1.jpg"}}}},"Kamen no Ninja - Akakage":{"id":"27163","GameTitle":"Kamen no Ninja: Akakage","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"05/20/1988","Overview":"Kamen no Ninja: Akakage is an Action game, developed by Shouei and published by Toei Animation, which was released in Japan in 1988.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Toei Animation","Developer":"Shouei","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27163-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"450","height":"311","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27163-1.jpg"}}}},"Kang Ti Wu Wang":{},"Kanshakudama Nage Kantarou no Toukaidou Gojuusan Tsugi":{"id":"27164","GameTitle":"Kanshakudama Nage Kantarou no Toukaidou Gojuusan Tsugi","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"08/03/1986","Overview":"Although commonly referred to as Tokaido Gojuusan Tsugi, the full name of the game is Kanshakudama Nage Kantarou no Toukaidou Gojuusan Tsugi, which can be roughly translated as \"explosive throwing Kantarou and the 53 stations of the Tokaido\".

Before the end of 1988, a version of the same game was released with an updated player roster, under the title Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium '88 Senshuu Shin Data.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Taito","Developer":"Taito","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/37470-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"852","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/37470-1.jpg"}}}},"Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium - Heisei Gannen Han":{"id":"37469","GameTitle":"Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium III","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"03/01/1991","Overview":"Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium III is a Sports game, developed and published by Taito Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1991.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Taito","Developer":"Taito","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/37469-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"424","height":"575","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/37469-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/37469-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"445","height":"578","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/37469-1.jpg"}}]}},"Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium 3":{},"L'Empereur":{"id":"1942","GameTitle":"L'Empereur","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1991","Overview":"L'Empereur is a military strategy game.

It is based on the 1986 film of the same name which was directed by Jim Henson, produced by George Lucas, and featuring David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King, and Jennifer Connelly as Sarah Williams. Although it was published by Activision, who held the world right publishing rights to video game adaptations of the movie, it is distinctly different from the version of Labyrinth which was developed by Lucasfilm Games (now LucasArts), and published by Activision for the Commodore 64/128, Apple II, and MSX2.\r\n\r\n15 year old Sarah is so resentful of her baby brother Toby that she hopes he will just disappear. Her dream becomes reality when goblins kidnap the boy—but Sarah unexpectedly finds herself horrified by the loss. So she sets forth to retrieve him, and finds herself on the adventure of a lifetime. To accomplish her task, she will somehow have to reach the center of the fantastical labyrinth where the wicked Goblin King has imprisoned the lad. But the task is easier said than done, for the maze is filled with strange creatures and mind-bending puzzles that confuse the girl.\r\n\r\nWhile the film was fairly successful in the United States, it developed a rather large following in Japan. Developed Tokuma Shoten created this action-adventure game that was more accurate to the film than the Lucasfilms Games version. The gameplay employed a top-down view similar to The Legend of Zelda, and featured many interesting tricks and puzzles, including levels that played with spatial relationships. Walking through certain avenues found in the levels would seamlessly warp you to another location in the level without any noticeable indication; the surrounding environment of the destination was designed to match the environment of the origin completely. Instead of using a health meter, a running clock displays how much time is remaining, and contact with enemies removes bits of time.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Activision","Developer":"Tokuma Shoten","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"35236","PlatformId":"4954"},{"id":"33844","PlatformId":"4929"},{"id":"41059","PlatformId":"8"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27172-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"384","height":"257","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27172-1.jpg"}}}},"Lagrange Point":{"id":"26474","GameTitle":"Lagrange Point","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"04/26/1991","Overview":"In the 22nd century, mankind has begun to emigrate into outer space.

The scene is the town's main street, with a view from behind the Sheriff's back (the view is so close that only the Sheriff's waist, right arm and gun are visible). Various other characters appear on the main street in front of the Sheriff.\r\n\r\nThe actual gameplay mostly concerns the Sheriff discussing with the various characters via a selection menu similar to those in contemporary graphical adventures. For each line the other character says, the game offers a selection of four different responses, and the discussion progresses depending on the chosen response. Law of the West marks the first use of this now-common interaction style.\r\n\r\nAs well as the discussion, the Sheriff occasionally gets involved in gunfights. In this case, the gameplay becomes a pure test of shooting skills, as the Sheriff has to shoot his opponent before getting shot himself. Gunplay is accomplished by pushing up on the joystick to draw the weapon, which causes a joystick-controlled crosshairs to appear on the screen. The various characters would react if the Sheriff drew his gun before they had a chance to say their opening line, usually refusing to speak until the gun was put away.\r\n\r\nIf the Sheriff gets shot, he blacks out, and the doctor is called to help. Depending on the Sheriff's previous interaction with the doctor and the other characters in the game (and if the doctor's in town), he may either be healed, or left for dead (either by the doctor refusing to help, or the doctor being drunk at the time). The only goal of the game is for the player to make it alive to the end of the day; if the player wishes he can gun down every character he meets without talking to them albeit this will be reflected negatively in the final score.","Genres":{"genre":"Adventure"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","Developer":"TOSE","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"38326","PlatformId":"40"}},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27174-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"432","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27174-1.jpg"}}}},"Layla":{"id":"27175","GameTitle":"Layla","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"12/20/1986","Overview":"Layla has to rescue her friend Iris from a genetically modified apparatus named Jill; who is apparently controlled by a Dr. Manitoka. As a member of the CAT Special Forces, Layla has all the skills needed to foil Dr. Manitoka's plans.\r\n\r\nEight different asteroids have to be explored before being able to rescue Layla's best friend.[2] Each asteroid is divided into two sections; the first part involving the surface of the asteroid while the second part deals with the actual enemy base.\r\n\r\nThere is an equally large mechanical element to the level as there is a biological element. The screen always scrolls from left to right. No backtracking is permitted on any level. While navigating through the cavern-like interiors of the asteroids, enemies must be defeated and password disks must be retrieved. At the final room of each asteroid lies a boss that must be defeated before being able to move on. Several guns in addition to some hand grenades can be used to destroy the bad guys impeding Layla's progress. The handgun is the player's initial weapon; but more powerful weapons can be found just by exploring. Certain blocks can be broken by using the player's chosen weapon; the difference between destroyable blocks and non-destroyable blocks is sometimes indistinguishable.\r\n\r\nBonus levels distributed throughout the game allows players to destroy entire squadrons of enemy ships while being completely impervious to their attacks. Players must be wary that every weapon has a limited amount of bullets; players can possess more than one sub-weapon at a time. When Layla's life reaches zero, she dies and immediately loses a life. A password is shown after the player loses the game. This is done so that players can resume their progress at a later date. The final boss of the game has to be defeated twice in order to end the final stage; both the neck and the body of the enemy must be eliminated.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"dB-SOFT","Developer":"dB-SOFT","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27175-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"450","height":"309","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27175-1.jpg"}}}},"Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf":{"id":"1882","GameTitle":"Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"03/24/1988","Overview":"Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf is a Golf Sim game, developed and published by SNK, which was released in 1988.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"4+","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"SNK","Developer":"SNK","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1882-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1540","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1882-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1882-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1526","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1882-1.jpg"}}]}},"Legacy of the Wizard":{"id":"1478","GameTitle":"Legacy of the Wizard","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"07/17/1987","Overview":"Long, long ago, an evil dragon terrorized the forest until it was imprisoned by a powerful wizard.

Also, it automatically calculates and displays the score on the screen.\r\n\r\nMahjong is a game based on the popular Chinese table game of the same name. It was released by Nintendo for the Famicom and Famicom Disk System, and was one of the earliest titles for both systems.\r\n\r\nMahjong (stylized on cart as \"MAH-JONG\") is a video game simulation of the board game of the same name, a tile-based multiplayer game that is similar to the card game Rummy. Nintendo themselves developed and published the game and it was one of the very first original games created for the Famicom/NES system, along with Gomoku Narabe Renju (another board game adaptation). The game was later adapted for the Famicom Disk System. It was never released outside of Japan.\r\n\r\nMahjong follows the popular Japanese \"Riichi\" rule set and is adapted for play against a single CPU opponent. Three different modes are available (in order from top to bottom):\r\n\r\nBeginner - No timer or penalties\r\nIntermediate - No timer; a 12,000 point chombo penalty is imposed for calling an invalid win\r\nAdvanced - A 10-second limit is imposed, chombo applies; CPU is more aggressive\r\n\r\nA full game consists of three matches, each consisting of East and South rounds, each round further consisting of East and South winds (West and North are not played, so rounds progress after only two dealer changes). The player with the highest point total at the end of each match is declared the winner of that match, and the best of three matches is declared winner at the end of the game.\r\n\r\nLeft/Right and A are used to draw, select, and discard tiles. Up/Down and B are used to select and make calls.\r\n\r\nOther gameplay notes and special rules:\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to go bust; rounds continue even if a player's score drops into the negatives, and Riichi can still be called with less than 1,000 points.\r\nThe Dora and Ura-Dora indicators are the Dora tiles themselves, not the next in sequence.\r\nRed Dora tiles are not used.\r\nIn all modes, there is a 3-second window after the final discard to declare a win; even if the final discard is a winning tile, the game will automatically end the round if the player does not call in time.\r\nTenpai payments are 1,500 instead of 3,000.\r\nRyanshi (two yaku minimum) is enforced after 5 honba.\r\nThe honba counter counts up to 9, but rounds can continue beyond that with the counter looping around to 0. With only two players, high honba counts are common.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Nintendo","Developer":"Nintendo","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"23045","PlatformId":"4917"},{"id":"36644","PlatformId":"4949"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/40557-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"432","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/40557-1.jpg"}}}},"Mahjong Block":{"id":"37006","GameTitle":"Mahjong Block","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1991","Overview":"Mahjong Block is a Puzzle game, developed by TXC Corp and published by Micro Genius, which was released in Asia in 1991.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Micro Genius","Developer":"TXC Corp","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/37006-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"256","height":"224","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/37006-1.png"}}}},"Mahjong Club - Nagatachou":{"id":"40558","GameTitle":"Mahjong Club Nagatacho: Sousaisen","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"04/25/1991","Overview":"Mahjong Club Nagatacho: Sousaisen is a Miscellaneous game, published by Hect, which was released in Japan in 1991.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Hect","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/40558-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"210","height":"324","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/40558-1.jpg"}}}},"Mahjong RPG Dora Dora Dora":{},"Mahjong Taikai":{"id":"40560","GameTitle":"Mahjong Taikai","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"10/31/1989","Overview":"The first installment in Koei's mahjong series.\r\n\r\nMahjong Taikai (\"Mahjong Tournament\") is a 1989 Famicom mahjong game from Koei and an unknown developer.

Instead of rooms full of fixtures that items might be hidden behind, the player must search beaches on islands for items buried in the sand. Specifically, they need to assemble a missile from its parts, presumably so it can be launched at the opponent spy's home country. Finding the missile will allow the victorious spy to escape the island via a submarine (which inexplicably also includes an attractive woman). There are also traps which, like in the original, can be placed in spots where missile parts might be to fool opponents into killing themselves.\r\n\r\nThe game was released on many of the home computers and consoles active at the time.

Princess Sakura has been kidnapped by Damazu-Dayuu, and because Ninja-Kun is away on a journey, the task falls to young JaJaMaru-kun.\r\n\r\nIn the game, the player starts with three lives and can only run, jump and throw shurikens. The game is divided into stages, each with four floors and eight enemies. Sakura-Hime and Damazu are placed, unreachable, at the top of the screen. Enemies use various projectiles, one of which will cause the player to lose a life. If JaJaMaru-kun lands on top of an enemy, it will simply be temporarily stunned and vice versa. Once an enemy is defeated and offscreen, a spirit will appear and ascend to the top of the screen. It can be collected before it has disappeared to receive points, which vary depending on the enemy. Sakura will sometimes drop petals that the player can collect, and Damazu will sometimes run around, dropping bombs. To advance to the next stage, the player must defeat all eight enemies by using shurikens.\r\n\r\nSome bricks yield items. They include:\r\n\r\n    A cart that temporarily makes JaJaMaru-kun invincible and faster. Projectiles and enemies will also be destroyed if touched.\r\n    A bottled substance that makes JaJaMaru temporarily invincible and able to walk through enemies.\r\n    A red ball that increases speed.\r\n    Bombs (which must be avoided).\r\n    Coins that yield various amounts of points.\r\n    An extra life.\r\n\r\nIf all three types of power-ups are collected, Gamapa-kun, a giant frog, will be summoned, which is completely invincible and able to eat all enemies.

While ostensibly a racing game, the style of gameplay tends to change per level.\r\n\r\nParis-Dakar Rally Special! is an unusual racing game in which the player must successfully win the Paris-Dakar Rally. However, in order to do so, the player is faced with a wide variety of odd challenges to overcome, a scant number of which actually involve racing.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by ISCO for the NES, Paris-Dakar Rally is notorious for its bizarre structure. Depending on who is asked it is either a testament to the NES library's occasionally creative and off-beat ingenuity, or a legendary \"kusoge\" (crap game).\r\n\r\nStage 1 - Preparation\r\nIn the first stage the player is without vehicle. In order to race in the Paris-Dakar Rally, the player must first acquire a sponsor, some money, a car and a navigation partner. In order to achieve these objectives, the player must walk around town and talk to the right order of sponsors, executives, bank tellers and rally co-ordinators to begin. Once the car has been purchased and a navigation partner chosen (which is resolved with a fast reactions mini-game), the player can take a plane to Paris to begin the rally.\r\n\r\nStage 2 - First Day\r\nThe first day races most closely resemble an actual racing game. The player has a top-down view of a vertically-scrolling track and must control the car's speed and direction with the D-pad. In order to qualify for the next stage of the event, the player must make it through the course within a time limit while dodging hostile vehicles from behind and in front. Losing three lives restarts the stage.\r\n\r\nStage 3 - Second Day\r\nThis mode more closely resembles the Arcade game Rally-X. The player must maneuver and corner around the Parisian streets in order to avoid rival drivers. They can distract pursuing CPU opponents by dropping rubber balls (possibly tires) behind the player's car to deter them.\r\n\r\nStage 4 - Third Day\r\nThe action changes to a side-scrolling perspective and now the player must contend with birds dropping deadly eggs, bridges that collapse once driven on, rolling boulders, fires and other obstacles on the racecourse. Occasionally, the player will need to leave the vehicle in order to hit a switch to extend a bridge before they can continue.\r\n\r\nStage 5 - Fourth Day\r\nAs the player is on a variant of the Paris-Dakar course that will inconveniently cross a major sea, the player must steer their car-boat over and under the ocean and avoid various hostile sea creatures and jagged rocks.\r\n\r\nStage 6 - Fifth Day\r\nInto the Dakar desert, the player must drive vertically up the screen while avoiding vicious desert animals like snakes, scorpions, spiders, camels and other hostile racers. The player must also contend with some narrow walls and a section where they must cross between two rafts.\r\n\r\nStage 7 - Sixth Day\r\nAt some point between starting the race and the sixth day, World War 3 broke out and the player must use their newly mounted machine guns to take down the enemy aircraft and tanks between them and the finishing line.\r\n\r\nStage 8 - Final Day\r\nThe Dakar finish line is just ahead, all the player must do is survive a gauntlet similar to that of the First Day. As with that stage, the player must be alert for other racers all around them and make it to the end within the time limit.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"CBS Sony Group","Developer":"ISCO","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/40637-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"444","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/40637-1.jpg"}}}},"Parodius":{"id":"2003","GameTitle":"Parodius","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"11/30/1990","Overview":"One day, our octopus friend gets into a fight to the death with his old rival, the bug.

It was published by Bandai for the Famicom in late 1987.\r\n\r\nPro Yakyuu Family Stadium '87 is the second game in Namco's long running Family Stadium series, also known as Famista. It's a traditional baseball game that allows one human player against the CPU, two competing human players and two competing CPU players in a \"Watch\" spectator mode.\r\n\r\nRather than being a full sequel to Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium the game is instead an updated version of the original, which was reflected in its lower price at release. It adds a few features and updates the official rosters for the athletes, but is functionally identical to the original Family Stadium. This specific type of annualization would become common practice for sports game franchises such as Madden NFL and NHL.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that this game is unrelated to R.B.I. Baseball 2 from Tengen. The original R.B.I. Baseball and Family Stadium were one and the same, the former receiving a name change to appeal to a Western audience, but after that initial game both franchises diverged. R.B.I.

As with EA Sports's present-day practice, Namco released these games annually with little to distinguish each new iteration. Most notable of the smattering of minor new additions is allowing the player to choose their venue from four options, ranging from a fully-packed stadium to a park.\r\n\r\nThough this is the second sequel to Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, which was released in the US by Tengen as R.B.I. Baseball, Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88 is not to be confused with R.B.I. Baseball 3. Though the first R.B.I. Baseball was a direct localization, subsequent R.B.I.

It is the third game in Babylonian Castle Saga series which started with the 1984 arcade game, The Tower of Druaga.\r\n\r\nThe story of The Quest of Ki is actually a prequel to the original Tower of Druaga. It occurs shortly after the demon Druaga has stolen the Blue Crystal Rod and taken it to his tower. The goddess Ishtar sends the priestess Ki to the tower in order to retrieve it. The game then follows her doomed quest to the top of the tower, and leads directly into the story of the original game.\r\n\r\nThe game is a side-scrolling platformer with one hundred levels. In each level, the player's goal is to pick up a key and open the door leading to the next area. Various enemies, including slimes, ghosts, and wizards, appear on each floor, and any contact with them results in death.\r\n\r\nKi has no weapons, and thus can not damage or defeat any of the enemies. Her only abilities are to dash and jump. As long as the player holds the jump button down, Ki can rise indefinitely into the air. However, contact with the ceiling will cause her to drop to the ground and become stunned for several seconds.\r\n\r\nMany of the levels consist of puzzles in which the player must carefully regulate the height and direction of Ki's jumps. Each stage in the game contains one or more treasure chest, which hold various items. Although many of the items bestow helpful abilities, the effects only last for the floor on which they were found.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the game, players can gain access to forty bonus stages. These stages contain cameos from the Pac-Man ghosts and the enemies from Dig Dug.","Genres":{"genre":"Platform"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Namco","Developer":"Game Studio","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/30942-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"265","height":"396","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/30942-1.png"}}}},"R.B.I.

With their greedy eyes on RollerGames' mega prize money, they've corrupted three teams and kidnapped Emerson \"Skeeter\" Bankhead, the games' beloved commissioner. You and your own three teams of righteous skate kings must stop V.I.P.E.R.'s criminal venom from infecting the entire city. So you've got to take the fight to the streets. And the sewers, and the junkyards, and the highways and the jungles... through 6 stages of dastardly traps of doom as you leap over open manholes, careening oil drums and treacherous landslides. Race around oil slicks and man-eating canines. And avoid ambush by combat copters, bomb-wielding goons and creeps like Captain Meat Hook and the Fish Face. But time is against you. And so are V.I.P.E.R.'s judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and other assorted sinister scum. If your multi-faceted fists can't punch you through, you'll need your special assault body blocks, jump kicks and double-whammy slams.

Though most of the Moero!! Pro Yakyuu games were released in the US as Bases Loaded, this one was not.\r\n\r\nShin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu (New Burning!! Pro Baseball) is the sixth of Jaleco/TOSE's Moero!! series of sports games (it's occasionally referred to as Moero 6!! Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu) and the third in the series to be associated with baseball. The first two Moero!! Pro Yakyuu games saw localizations in the US as Bases Loaded and Bases Loaded 2, but Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu was skipped. What eventually became Bases Loaded 3 was instead the fourth Moero!! Pro Yakyuu game, Moero 8!! Pro Yakyuu '90 Kandouhen.\r\n\r\nThe biggest difference between the previous Moero!! Pro Yakyuu/Bases Loaded games and this one is the slanted perspective for batting and pitching. Instead of the camera being behind the batter or pitcher, the player can see both from an angle, with the two situated diagonally from each other. Likewise, the baseball diamond is shown at an angle making it appear more like a square, with the rest of the field stretching outwards. Despite this new perspective, the game controls similarly to previous Bases Loaded games.\r\n\r\nA curious addition is that of the biorhythms, which tells the player how each athlete is feeling: If the athlete is having an off-game, one or more of these biorhythms will be low and the player will need to strategize around these dips. Though big in 70s sports punditry, the idea of mathematical biorhythms predicting an athlete's prowess in any upcoming game was all but discredited as pseudoscience by the time when this game came out.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Jaleco Entertainment","Developer":"TOSE","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/40857-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"374","height":"384","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/40857-1.jpg"}}}},"Shin Samurai Spirits 2 - Haoumaru Jigoku Hen":{"id":"27683","GameTitle":"Shin Samurai Spirits 2","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","Genres":{"genre":"Fighting"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27683-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"256","height":"224","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27683-1.png"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/27683-1.jpg","$":{"width":"480","height":"360"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/27683-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/27683-2.jpg","$":{"width":"480","height":"360"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/27683-2.jpg"}]}},"Shin Satomi Hakken-Den - Hikari to Yami no Tatakai":{"id":"40858","GameTitle":"Shin Satomi Hakkenden: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"12/08/1989","Overview":"Shin Satomi Hakkenden: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai is a Role-Playing game, developed by Micronics and published by Toei Animation, which was released in Japan in 1989.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Toei Animation","Developer":"Micronics","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/40858-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"214","height":"300","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/40858-1.jpg"}}}},"Shingen The Ruler":{"id":"1413","GameTitle":"Shingen the Ruler","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"06/01/1989","Overview":"Shingen Takeda was one of the most powerful warlords of medival Japan.

To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.)

Based on the 1975 novel by James Clavell.\r\n\r\nThe 1975 novel that Shogun is based on, also called Shogun, details the rise of a fictional Daimyo Toranaga over many years, as he rises in power to become the military leader of a Japan united under his rule. The story is told from the perspective of a foreign sailor.\r\n\r\nThe game allows players to assume the role of Toranaga or one of his rivals and assist them in becoming Shogun. This is done by walking through areas and finding ways of drawing others to the player character's cause, or simply eliminating them if the former path is not an option. It was developed by Virgin Interactive for many home systems, such as the Commodore 64.\r\n\r\nIn 1988 the game was reworked by Japanese company Hect to more closely resemble a Zelda-like top-down view (opposed to the original's side-scrolling perspective) and was drastically changed graphically. The goal and general gameplay remain the same, however.

Fuji Television created a 43 episode anime series based on the novel in 1988, and this video game adaptation is based on that TV show. Fuji Television is perhaps best known in western video game circles for being responsible for Doki Doki Panic (the game the American/European Super Mario Bros 2 is based on) as well as airing GameCenter CX (or Retro Game Master).\r\n\r\nThe game plays much like a regular Famicom adventure game: The player walks around, talks to people and finds items which are used to solve puzzles.

The game is divided into five scenes with one-four areas with a boss at the end of each area.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sunsoft","Developer":"EIM","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/22455-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"800","height":"1112","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/22455-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22455-1.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22455-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22455-2.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22455-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22455-3.jpg","$":{"width":"300","height":"272"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22455-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22455-4.jpg","$":{"width":"150","height":"168"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22455-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22455-5.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22455-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22455-6.jpg","$":{"width":"512","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22455-6.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22455-7.jpg","$":{"width":"480","height":"360"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22455-7.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/22455-8.jpg","$":{"width":"480","height":"450"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/22455-8.jpg"}]}},"Super Arabian":{"id":"27288","GameTitle":"Super Arabian","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"07/25/1985","Overview":"Super Arabian is an Action game, developed and published by SunSoft, which was released in Japan in 1985.","Genres":{"genre":"Platform"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"SunSoft","Developer":"SunSoft","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27288-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"300","height":"206","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27288-1.jpg"}}}},"Super Black Onyx":{"id":"27298","GameTitle":"Super Black Onyx","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"04/14/1988","Overview":"Super Black Onyx (スーパーブラックオニキス?) is an RPG developed by Bullet Proof Software for the Famicom and published in Japan in 1988.

This comparison is also true for the sport of badminton itself, which has a similar focus on performing hard-to-counter spike attacks close to the net in order to score points. Because of the irregular flight path of a shuttlecock, the player needs to focus more on its shadow than the projectile itself in order to play effectively.\r\n\r\nThough the game has options for both male and female characters every character sprite is the same androgynous black-haired person. The only real change is that games are shorter for female competitors as they would be in real life. The game also allows for four different \"coats\" on the main menu - as these change the venue the competitors are playing in, this is presumably a mistranslation of \"courts\".","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Vap","Developer":"Pax Softonica","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27299-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"300","height":"206","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27299-1.jpg"}}}},"Super Fighter III":{},"Super Glove Ball":{"id":"2120","GameTitle":"Super Glove Ball","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"10/01/1990","Overview":"Your shuttle commander has been trapped in a dimensional maze in space, and you must use your glove to throw an energy ball at the walls in order to advance.\r\n\r\nThe walls in each maze room you encounter are filled with blocks.

After Namco excited the market for baseball games with the release of Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, many other companies attempted to meet the demand for more baseball games.\r\n\r\nThis title differentiated itself from other baseball games by obtaining permission from the Professional Baseball Organization of Japan to use the official names of the 12 Japanese baseball teams and their players. This was a groundbreaking feature at the time. It was also the first game to depict an existing stadium with it's actual name, the Tokyo Dome, which had just opened shortly before the game's release. Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time, was chosen to help promote the game.\r\n\r\nTo further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field. Despite these changes, and efforts to promote the game, it was considered very difficult to play, as it employed rather complex controls for batting, pitching, and fielding that were not easy for many players to perform.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Vap","Developer":"Pax Softonica","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27302-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"424","height":"600","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27302-1.jpg"}}}},"Super Robin Hood":{"id":"37504","GameTitle":"Super Robin Hood","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"11/01/1985","Overview":"You are Robin Hood.

Tengen, an ambitious Atari-associated game developer, began releasing official NES games in 1988. Meanwhile, the company worked rapidly behind the scenes to override Nintendo's infamous lockout device that kept unofficial cartridges from being played on its console. When Tengen released its first unofficial games using its new technology, Nintendo quickly sued. This was just the beginning of the Tengen/Nintendo feud. Ignoring Nintendo's claim to the Tetris name in the US a year later, Tengen released its own version of the world's most famous puzzle game on an unlocked, unofficial cartridge. Tengen's tetris was pulled from shelves almost immediately when it was revealed that Nintendo's hold on the Tetris name stateside was legitimate. Unfortunately, almost everyone agrees that Tengen's version of the game was far superior to Nintendo's, even including a two-player mode which Nintendo's version sorely lacked. Today, the game known as Tengen Tetris is a rare title to have in your collection, but it's a worthwhile play.

Ever since his inception into the Mario Bros. universe in Super Mario Bros., where he would so kindly inform Mario that the Princess was actually in another castle, he has been treated as a second-rate character. His only major roles were in Super Mario Bros. 2 (as a playable character), in the puzzle game, Wario's Woods, as the only controllable character, and more recently, in New Super Mario Bros. Wii, proving that the little mushroom boy has not yet been completely abandoned. Still, for such an iconic character to be chained to the background is unseemly!\r\nLuckily, the hacker known as \"Omniverse\" has taken it upon himself to remedy the situation somewhat, crafting \"Toad's Adventure: Where's Mario?\" as Toad's new vessel to stardom. Using the original Super Mario Bros. as a foundation, Omniverse has not only replaced all the Mario sprites with those of Toad, as drawn in Super Mario Bros. 2, but also designed a completely new set of levels (though, based on certain geographical elements, I can see that very minor parts of the original levels have remained intact to some capacity). The overall colour palette is generally darker than before; scenic aspects from Super Mario Bros. 2 and 3 have been inserted in place of the more cubist style of their predecessors, such as log surfaces and the more rounded question blocks. Enemy sprites have also changed to a degree; Goombas are far more round and cartoonish, while Bullet Bills have been replaced with the flying Para-Beetles from Super Mario Bros. 3. And as for Bowser, he sure doesn't look the same anymore either...\r\n\r\nThe most important thing to note, however, is that this game is HARD. Omniverse has gone out of his way to insert large gaps between platforms all over the place and numerous other platform placement quirks that all require precise and lengthy leaps of faith. For whatever reason as well, Bowser requires more fireball hits to be defeated. Well, I thought five was too easy in the original game anyhow. Oh, but don't get me started on ropes... Ropes, not unlike those of Donkey Kong Jr., have been included in some levels, but because Toad acts rather unusually to them, they are more of a nuisance than any provision of fun. Toad can't really hop off them; he can only FALL off those ropes, leading to some untimely deaths. (As well, climbing to the very top will cause him to fall straight downward into the chasm below, resulting in yet another unnecessary demise.) It would be an absolute nightmare to even consider completing this game on a real console. Frankly, I'm impressed at the Toad's abilities; I didn't think the lad had it in him to survive this rough ordeal. With an adventure like this, I'm sure Toad is wishing he was back at the castle...","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Platform"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Omniverse","Developer":"Omniverse","Rating":"7","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/37267-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"580","height":"1024","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/37267-1.png"}}}},"Tower of Druaga, The":{"id":"27325","GameTitle":"The Tower of Druaga","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"08/06/1985","Overview":"The Tower of Druaga is a maze-based action role-playing game from Namco, created on the Mappy engine and originally released in Arcades in 1984 and later ported to consoles such as the NES, Game Boy and MSX as well as appearing in numerous Namco compilations, such as Namco Museum Vol. 3 for the PlayStation in 1997. The game is the first in the Babylonian Castle Saga and second chronologically. In 1992, the game was remade for the PC Engine which saw numerous changes detailed below.\r\n\r\nCombining hack & slash real-time combat with some basic RPG elements, it laid the foundations for early action role-playing games such as Dragon Slayer and Hydlide. Its hack & slash combat included the ability to both attack with a sword by pressing the attack button and defend with a shield by standing still. It attracted millions of fans in Japan and went on to inspire early action RPGs such as Dragon Slayer, Hydlide, Ys and The Legend of Zelda. The game also debuted the Slime monsters which would later become the mascot of the Dragon Quest series.\r\n\r\nThe game served the basis of an anime series, The Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of Uruk, from studio Gonzo and was broadcast between April 2008 to March 2009. The anime takes place 60 years after the events of the game. A noteworthy element of the anime is the music, composed by famed video game composer Hitoshi Sakimoto.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Namco","Developer":"Namco","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"24422","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"24805","PlatformId":"34"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27325-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"396","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27325-1.jpg"}}}},"Toxic Crusaders":{"id":"2778","GameTitle":"Toxic Crusaders","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"04/01/1992","Overview":"Based on Troma's cartoon series of the same name, the Toxic Crusaders protect the city of Tromaville against the plots of the alien Dr. Killemoff and his Radiation Rangers.

The object is to acquire all of the enemies' territory and defeat the evil gang leaders. Even though this game was only released in Japan, the gangsters fight without any weapons and the violence level is mild compared to later gang-related games. Its spiritual descendant is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas due to its simulation of gang warfare.\r\n\r\nOnce the main gang leader is defeated in either Tsuppari Wars (ツッパリウォーズ?) or Tsuppari Suku (ツッパリスク?) mode, the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently, all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the \"neutral gangs.\" These \"neutral gangs\" will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue, or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying \"no\" when asked to fight (たたかい?, \"Struggle\").\r\n\r\nNeutral gangs, fortunately, do not have ability to invade the territories of the red, blue, or green colored gangs. There are three difficulty levels for computer opponents and games are possible with two or three colors (but never with only one color). After naming the character (using the Japanese alphabet), the player must select his face that will represent his main gang leader. The two gang leaders involved will use a special fighting game engine to settle their differences while individual gang members will fight each other through a special battle screen. The battle screen allows players to use special effects against the opponent like a motorcycle, a thunderstorm, or even a quick call to the police's riot squad. All brawls are timed by a timer which is never seen in the game.\r\n\r\nThat means if there is no determined winner in a certain number of time, the brawl ends with a stalemate and no territory gains or losses are made. The brawl can be re-initiated either during the player's next turn or during the opponent's turn. There are eight different maps to choose from that depict the world in a manner similar to the board game Risk. There are islands with land bridges and bodies of water to them. Between combat, the player can either move (いどうし?, \"Not among\") his gang members from territory to territory or immediately end his turn. It is possible for a player to transfer all of his gang members out of a territory, turning it into a blank grey territory without a number.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"3","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sammy Studios","Developer":"Sammy Studios","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27327-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"285","height":"199","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27327-1.jpg"}}}},"Tsuri Kichi Sanpei - Blue Marlin Hen":{},"Tsuru Pika Hagemaru - Mezase!

All the animals were docile. Humans, Sandras, Quarkmen, Tattas, and other races mingled with one another and worked to make Marvel Land into an increasingly beautiful place to live. A large clock tower resembling a stone grandfather clock stood watch over the countryside of Marvel Land. Long ago, an ancient evil had been sealed within the clock tower. The people needn't fret, however. For those days had long since passed, or so they had thought.\r\n\r\nThe key of time that rested in the center of the face of the clock tower had long since been used to seal away the ancient evil that lies within. Until one day, the clock tower mysteriously stopped working. In an effort to rewind the clock, a villager takes it upon himself to do just that. Fumbling with the key, the villager drops the key of time, foolishly. In a frantic manner, the villager picks up the key and tries to reset it back into place before a catastrophe befalls Marvel Land. But then, it was too late for the villager to accomplish the task. The ancient evil of legend. Zouna, the Dark Wizard who manipulates time itself was unleashed upon the world once more. And to prevent anyone else from sealing him away once again, Zouna takes the key of time for himself.\r\n\r\nFinally freed after many years, Zouna wastes no time in wreaking havoc and chaos over Marvel Land. Zouna unleashes his manifested darkness over the land, and lays waste to the countryside. Feeling confident in his reign, Zouna constructs his castle in which to preside over Marvel Land from. The peaceful inhabitants of Marvel Land cried out in terror as Zouna's manifested darkness came after them one by one. Zouna's darkness corrupted the hearts of anyone it came across, and possessed them against their wills. Once thriving towns and villages fell into ruination. Family members were parted from their loved ones. Only a few scattered towns remained standing; forming a last bastion in resistance to Zouna's dark invasion. A futile effort. Even Krino Sandra (known as Whirlo in Europe) would come to meet his heroic demise, subdued by Zouna's power. Marvel Land is in dire need of a savior.\r\n\r\nThe desperate call has been answered by the heavens. Valkyrie, a fledgling shield maiden descends to Marvel Land from heaven. Her first adventure, she wields a simple shield and a mace of light. Vowing to save Marvel Land from the darkness that has consumed it.

Zunou Senkan Galg is almost entirely unheard of outside of Japan, however, and has never seen a release outside of its native country.\r\n\r\nThough it was published by dB-Soft, the game was developed by a group named \"Team Bioteckers\".

If you get hit by an enemy, you will respawn at the point where you picked up the last virus. It’s a pretty simple concept overall.

The objective of the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. With every ten lines that are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the tetrominoes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter. In certain versions, the game can also end if the player is able to get all the way to level 15.\r\n\r\nAll of the tetrominoes are capable of single and double clears. I, J, and L are able to clear triples. Only the I tetromino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously, and this is referred to as a \"tetris\". (This may vary depending on the rotation and compensation rules of each specific Tetris implementation. For instance, in the Super Rotation System used in most recent implementations, called \"Easy Spin\" in Tetris Worlds, certain rare situations allow T, S and Z to 'snap' into tight spots and clear triples.)","Genres":{"genre":["Puzzle","Strategy"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Bullet-Proof Software","Developer":"Bullet-Proof Software","Rating":"7.25","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"12","Game":[{"id":"9513","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"28258","PlatformId":"4914"},{"id":"8828","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"7538","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"10616","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"23081","PlatformId":"4917"},{"id":"27521","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"20441","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"36886","PlatformId":"4913"},{"id":"20155","PlatformId":"12"},{"id":"24824","PlatformId":"13"},{"id":"27765","PlatformId":"4926"}]},"Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1424-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1424-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1424-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1424-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1424-3.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1424-3.jpg"}],"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1424-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1566","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1424-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1424-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1464","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1424-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1424-1.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1424-1.jpg"},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/1424.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"90"}}}},"Tetris (PD)":{"id":"25703","GameTitle":"Tetris (Tengen)","PlatformId":"7","Platform":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","ReleaseDate":"05/01/1989","Overview":"The drama surrounding Tetris is one of the most storied sagas in the history of the NES. Tengen, an ambitious Atari-associated game developer, began releasing official NES games in 1988. Meanwhile, the company worked rapidly behind the scenes to override Nintendo's infamous lockout device that kept unofficial cartridges from being played on its console. When Tengen released its first unofficial games using its new technology, Nintendo quickly sued. This was just the beginning of the Tengen/Nintendo feud. Ignoring Nintendo's claim to the Tetris name in the US a year later, Tengen released its own version of the world's most famous puzzle game on an unlocked, unofficial cartridge. Tengen's tetris was pulled from shelves almost immediately when it was revealed that Nintendo's hold on the Tetris name stateside was legitimate. Unfortunately, almost everyone agrees that Tengen's version of the game was far superior to Nintendo's, even including a two-player mode which Nintendo's version sorely lacked. Today, the game known as Tengen Tetris is a rare title to have in your collection, but it's a worthwhile play. After all, Tetris is one of the classic games not only on the NES, but of all-time.","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Tengen","Developer":"Atari","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/25703-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"531","height":"768","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/25703-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/25703-1.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"240"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/25703-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/25703-2.jpg","$":{"width":"418","height":"311"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/25703-2.jpg"}]}},"Tetris (Super Alpha Version) (PD)":{},"TextReader - 7 veljesta 2012 by KHS (PD)":{},"TextReader - NES 2012 by KHS (PD)":{},"There's Evidence by Hummer (PD)":{},"Thwaite V0.01 by Damian Yerrick (PD)":{},"Thwaite V0.02 by Damian Yerrick (PD)":{},"Thwaite V0.03 by Damian Yerrick (PD)":{},"Tic-Tac XO by Sly Dog Studios (PD)":{},"Tic-Tac by Sly Dog Studios (PD)":{},"Time Conquest V1 by _Demo_ and EFX (PD)":{},"Time Conquest V2 by _Demo_ and EFX (PD)":{},"Time Conquest V2x by _Demo_ and EFX (PD)":{},"Time Conquest Vx by _Demo_ and EFX (PD)":{},"Time Latency Test by Blargg (PD)":{},"Tiny Toon Adventures Title Screen Remake by Macbee v1.0 (PD)":{},"Toadman 7 Color Demake v1.0 by Macbee (PD)":{},"ToeJam & Earl Title Screen (PD)":{},"Tokumaru Raycaster 00 (PD)":{},"Tokumaru Raycaster 01 (PD)":{},"Tommy T's Play Me Sound Editor (PD)":{},"Tori PCM-Anime Demo by NES Hack Factory (PD)":{},"Tri Scale Demo (PD)":{},"Tu Long Dao":{},"Turbochk by Quietust (PD)":{},"Turbochk by Quietust (PD) ":{},"Turpasauna 2006 Invitation by wAMMA (PD) (PAL)":{},"Turquoise Palace EP Demo by Morphcat (PD)":{},"TwinBee Yahoo!!
