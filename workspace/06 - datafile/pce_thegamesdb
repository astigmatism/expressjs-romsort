One minute you're shoving several feet of cold steel between the gaping jaws of some evil robot dragon, and the next thing you know, you've been transformed into a fire breathing lizard man. Such is the problem that you first encounter at the beginning of Adventure Island, Hudson Soft's conversion of the Master System game 'Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'. Taking more of its influence from the second game in the Wonder Boy series than the first, Adventure Island has a more balanced structure and more exploratory gameplay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main game is centred around a small village which acts as a sort of 'hub' to the surrounding levels. Each of these levels are gradually accessed over time with the acquisition of keys or new transformations. As the game progresses, you will find yourself transforming into five different creatures, which can (and need to) be switched between in special rooms. The lizard is the basic transformation and does little more than breathe fire at any passing fauna. Mouse man is a tiny little critter and aside from being able to fit under small obstacles, he can also run up and around special chequered walls and ceilings. Next up is a green amphibian that gives you the power to swim around freely, followed by a tiger man who swings his sword around in a wide arc, allowing you to break blocks above and below. Finally, there is the bird transformation which lets you fly around by repeatedly tapping the jump button.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you progress, your quest will take you over many types of terrain from jungle to desert to the inside of a giant pyramid - but to help you out there is a password/backup save feature in a church in the main village. As you viciously hack up the cute little inhabitants of the island, you find that they considerately drop money and helpful items for you. The money is used in shops to upgrade your armour, or buy healing at the hospital, while the other items are special weapons that can be set from the pause menu. These include homing fireballs, ground based mini whirlwinds and arrows that shoot directly upwards (and are a blessing when you are trying to get rid of flame-dropping clouds).\",\"ESRB\":\"E10+ - Everyone 10+\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":[\"Adventure\",\"Platform\"]},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Hudson Soft\",\"Developer\":\"Westone\",\"Rating\":\"10\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"3\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"36286\",\"PlatformId\":\"4929\"},{\"id\":\"32242\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\"},{\"id\":\"14164\",\"PlatformId\":\"4\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/33520-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"399\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/33520-1.jpg\"}}}}","Aero Blasters":"{\"id\":\"4909\",\"GameTitle\":\"Aero Blasters\",\"AlternateTitles\":{\"title\":\"Air Buster\"},\"PlatformId\":\"34\",\"Platform\":\"TurboGrafx 16\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/01/1990\",\"Overview\":\"The player controls a small craft through different levels with many enemies.

Your game is played out in two teams, rather than two individuals, and the members of your team are chosen from a variety of weird and crazy looking characters with varying attributes.

Simply flying a ship into outer space simply wasn't going to cut it anymore. Taito had an idea. Yes, there was still a spaceship. And yeah, that \\\"outer space\\\" part was still there too. But instead of the usual aliens, you fought fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot even regular, aquatic fish, but robotic fish with lasers equipped to their fins, giant metal teeth and missiles firing from their gills. And not just fish either. There are squid, snails, and other undersea variations out for your blood as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe requisite plot is about the people of the planet Darius, who are being terrorized by said intergalatic fish. Only the heroic pilots Proco Jr and Tiat Young can save the day. The constant star of the Darius series is the Silver Hawk. Much like Gradius, it has a primary, forward firing weapon, along with bombs that can be used to attack vertically, and the usual shield.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arcade game Darius games also used a unique system that attached three monitors together to create one massive horizontal playing field (also used in Taito's Ninja Warriors.) Naturally, this couldn't quite be replicated on the console system, so that nifty little gimmick is lost, but emulators can still replicate the dimensions of the screen, even if you end up looking at a tiny picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking to further set itself apart from the crowd, every Darius game has multiple levels, with several branching paths throughout the game. It adds tremendously to the replay value, especially since there are usual multiple endings, depending on which final zone you end up at.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen was three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet used an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen various ports of it were made for different consoles, Taito (and others) were forced to shrink the playfield to fit on one screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was released for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, PC Engine, PC Engine (Super CD-ROM), Wii (Virtual Console), and ZX Spectrum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe PC Engine saw three releases:  \\r\\n\\r\\nDarius Alpha (1990): A very rare beta release. This is one of the rarest Hu-Cards ever published. You could only get a copy of this hardcore shoot-em-up by buying Darius Plus and Super Darius and then mailing coupons to the publisher. 800 copies were made available, and names were drawn from those who mailed their info in. Some copies of the game were also given away as prizes by PC Engine Gekken and Marakatsu magazines.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarius Plus (1990): The full game itself, again a PC Engine HuCard. The bosses that were removed in Alpha do not return here. Both Alpha and Plus were actually written for the PC Engine SuperGrafx and playing them on that console results in slightly improved graphics (less flicker and slowdown).\\r\\n\\r\\nSuper Darius (1990): A conversion of Darius for the PC Engine's Super CD-ROM, very close to the original arcade version other than being single-screen.

The game counts a grand total of eight zones - the first five are Combat Training Stages and happen in a virtual space where the player must at least achieve a whooping 90% destruction ratio. If successful, the Real Combat reveals itself and the player gets launched in outer space and fly through three more stages. Just like with any traditional shooter, the ship can be upgraded by collecting flying capsules. They come in two flavors - the first are colored pods (blue and red) which hang around the ship and either fire straight ahead or in the opposite direction the fighter is facing. Those pods can also be thrown at the enemies to inflict more damage. The other kind are various devices that attach at the front of the ship and greatly improve its fire power - they include Bubble lasers, Homing Lasers, V Lasers or the powerful Drill Laser. Sadly, only one can be collected at the same time and the only way to dispose of them is to get hit.

The gameplay is at least partly inspired by Falcom's Ys series.\\r\\n\\r\\nMakai Hakkenden Shada is an action-RPG from Data East that was released on the PC Engine (the Japanese TurboGrafx-16) in 1989. The game bears more than a close resemblance to Falcom's Ys: specifically the first game in the series, The Vanished Omens, which was a huge success for the PC Engine a few months prior as well as being a generally well-regarded computer RPG before then. As well as having a similar nude female figure in the opening intro, the game also borrows Ys's combat system: fighting occurs by walking into enemies at a slight angle, causing them to collide with the player character's weapon (which hurts them) rather than the player character himself (which hurts the player character). The various gauges for health and experience are also similar.\\r\\n\\r\\nMakai Hakkenden Shada is based on a centuries-old Japanese novel series called Nansou Satomi Hakkenden, or \\\"Eight Dog Chronicles\\\", that features eight half-brother samurai who are all descended from the same dog and have the Japanese word for \\\"dog\\\" somewhere in their names. While these books have been referenced or adapted many times in other media such as manga and film, Makai Hakkenden Shada and the Famicom RPGs Satomi Hakkenden and Shin Satomi Hakkenden: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai are the only direct video game adaptations. Okami also contained an oblique reference to the novels.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike Satomi Hakkenden, which eventually allowed the player to recruit all eight of the central characters of the novel series, Makai Hakkenden Shada only has the one playable character.

Due to a series of mysterious events, the town of Chany's Hill has been cut off from the rest of the world. People have suddenly gone missing and cannibalistic monsters now roam the land, killing all who cross their path. The protagonist of the game is Laila Arufon, the youngest female member of the S-SWAT (Supernatural and Special Weapon Attack Team). She was born in the small town and has developped strange psychic abilities. Her Psychic Seal (\\\"PS\\\") and Mind Force (\\\"MF\\\") powers allow her to increase any weapon destruction power but also to increase her defense capability greatly. Her mission is twofold - she must investigate the mysterious and supernatural incident in Chaneys Hill and to rescue all the remaining survivors she can find and lead them to the town's church. Laila comes equipped with a combat knife and a Hand Gun (SIG/SAUER P226) - additional weapons appear later in the game including the Assault Rifle (STYER AUG), Grenade launcher (HK MZP1), Flamethrower (M2A1-7), Bazooka (M72A2) and so forth. Although most of the game uses a traditional top-down view, battles quickly drop the game into side-scrolling action phases. There, Laila fights hordes of monsters to gain experience (blue orbs), life (reb orbs), MF points (green orbs) or ammunitions (pink cases). She can also escape at anytime as long as she can reach the edge of the fighting area. The combat items are complemented by more conventional inventory items such as medic packs, psychic pills, keys and so forth.

The Flag (F) and Bombs (B) cannot be moved.\\r\\nNo two units can occupy the same space. If an enemy unit and a player's unit meet, the one with the highest number (which correlates to a lower rank) is removed. The winning unit then moves into the empty space.

However, they are the only unit that can defeat the highest ranked unit - the Marshall, or #1. They can only do so if they are the attacker, not the defender.\\r\\nIf any unit touches a Bomb, they are removed from the board.

However, this technique depletes some of his magic energy which he has to refill periodically. But his ultimate weapon is the ability to turn into a powerful topless fighter - this technique is however only available for the toughest boss encounters located at the end of each area. In this form, our hero can use a powerful chain-whip (which consumes magic energy) to land more punishing blows than his bare fists. Throughout the game, various enemies drop magic orbs when defeated which range from power-ups (red P), increase max-life (green P), increase magic bar (green M), freeze time clocks, bombs, life potions and so forth. Each defeated enemy also drop money that can later be used to purchase life and magic from town people located at the end of each area.

As well as ports for the PC Engine, Genesis and the home computers Atari ST, Amiga and PC, Volfied was also released on the 2005 PS2 compilation Taito Legends and as a Java mobile game in Europe in 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn home consoles in North America, it was marketed under the more familiar QIX brand. It was known as The Jintori ~Volfied 1500 (Japan) and Neo QIX (US) for its PlayStation port, which was part of the Simple budget series. For its North American Sega Genesis release, it was known as Ultimate QIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nGameplay:\\r\\nAs with QIX, the goal is to carve out pieces of the playing field by drawing a box that encapsulates a certain percentage of the screen. While drawing these boxes, the player's vehicle is vulnerable to the various enemy craft patrolling the playing field. Areas within the drawn squares turn inert and are inaccessible by enemies. Once the player turns enough of the playing field inert, which is a minimum of 80% for Volfied (up from the 70% needed for QIX), the level is complete and the player earns a bonus based on how far over the minimum percentage amount they managed to achieve. Each screen has one large enemy that cannot be defeated: if the player cuts the field in half with one maneuver, the \\\"active\\\" playing field will be whichever side holds the large enemy. Smaller enemies, however, will be destroyed if they are inside the inert area.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolfied introduces small bonus pods that, once enveloped in a box, confer bonuses and power-ups to the player.

He destroys his enemies by firing small Ki bullets, which can be charged to increase their power; however, if overcharged, he is left unable to move or fight for a few seconds. During boss battles, Tarosuke kneels at a shrine to Buddha and prays, summoning \\\"Monmotaro\\\" (not to be confused with \\\"Momotarō\\\"), a spirit which floats in the air and drops energy balls on the boss and any lackeys he has. Once the boss is defeated, Tarosuke goes to the next stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Clovis from Dragon Buster, Taira no Kagekiyo from Genpei Tōma Den, and Momo Chan from Wonder Momo, Tarosuke has a life bar (labeled as \\\"POWER\\\") but only one life; if the meter is empty, the game is over (unless he has a certain item). There are no scoring systems present, but the game utilizes currency (only referred to as \\\"MONEY\\\") which is used to buy items, among other things.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are five stages: Jigoku Iriguchi (Gateway to Hell), Kugyou no Michi (Path of Penance), Yuukai (Ghost Sea), Sabaki no Tani (Valley of Judgment) and Rinnekai (Land of Transmigration). There are multiple paths which can be taken in many stages, which may influence which of the five endings the player gets. One of the paths leads the player to a fairly racy dance hall show, after which he is given a box. If he opens the box, he might get 10,000 in money, or might be turned into an old man until he buys a particular item in a shop (this is based on the tale of Urashima Tarō). There are five different endings depending on what Tarosuke did in the game:\\r\\n\\r\\n    He goes to Hell.\\r\\n    He goes to Hungry Ghoul World.\\r\\n    He goes to Beast World.\\r\\n    He returns to Human World.\\r\\n    He goes to Heaven.\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Namco\",\"Developer\":\"Namco\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"1\",\"Game\":{\"id\":\"26403\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\"}},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/38161-1.png\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"400\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/38161-1.png\"}}}}","Zelda V0.0 by Gravis Zero (PD)":{},"Zelda V0.2 by Gravis Zero (PD)":{},"Zelda V0.3 by Gravis Zero (PD)":{},"Zelda V0.4 by Gravis Zero (PD)":{},"Zelda V0.475 by Gravis Zero (PD)":{},"Zelda V0.6 by Gravis Zero (PD)":{},"Zelda V0.65 by Gravis Zero (PD)":{},"Zelda V1.0 - New Graphics by Gravis Zero (PD)":{},"Zelda V1.0 - Old Graphics by Gravis Zero (PD)":{},"Zero 4 Champ":"{\"id\":\"40705\",\"GameTitle\":\"Zero 4 Champ\",\"AlternateTitles\":{\"title\":\"ゼロヨンチャンプ\"},\"PlatformId\":\"34\",\"Platform\":\"TurboGrafx 16\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"03/08/1991\",\"Overview\":\"Japanese: ゼロヨンチャンプ.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a one on one racing adventure game.
