The game uses a vitality system instead of life system in which if the player is hit, it loses one point of vitality and the player is destroyed if hit with 0 vitality then the player is given the option to continue. Lightning attacks can be used by pressing the B button which sacrifices a portion of life energy. One is only able to perform three loops per level and a bonus is awarded at the end of the level for unused loops. Player 1 uses a P-38 Lightning and Player 2 uses a new plane: Mosquito Mk IV. The game shifts from the original Pacific Front setting with that of the Western Front, in the north Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of six levels: North Atlantic Ocean Sky, European Sea Port, V3 Rocket Site, Brandenburg Gate, Open Plains and The Enemy Base. There are 6 bosses:Leviathan, German battleship Bismarck, V3 Rocket, Krote, Super Leviathan and Gotha (Horten Ho 229). Also, there are common enemies like: Ju 87 Stuka, Bf 110, Me 262 Schwalbe, Focke-Achgelis Fa 223, Sdkfz 251, Flak 88, Tiger I and U-boat.","Genres":{"genre":"Shooter"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"Yes","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__id5snwOOw","Publisher":"Capcom","Developer":"Capcom","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"2434","PlatformId":"23"}},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/23252-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"300","height":"271","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/23252-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/23252.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"156"}}}},"1943 Kai":{"id":"23253","GameTitle":"1943: Kai","AlternateTitles":{"title":"1943: The Battle of Midway"},"PlatformId":"34","Platform":"TurboGrafx 16","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1987","Overview":"Developed and released alongside the Family Computer version, 1943 Kai: Midway Kaisen is an arcade game, an \"alternate\" version of the original 1943, released in 1987[3] only in Japan. Most of the graphics and sounds have been reworked, and the game has been made more \"extreme\" (laser-firing WWII planes and ships that run on ground). Further, the trademark P-38 has been replaced with a Boeing Stearman E75 N68828.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, this version was converted to the PC Engine as simply 1943 Kai, again Japan-only; this version itself contains many additional levels and original music.\r\n\r\nThe game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese air fleet that bombed the American aircraft carrier, pursue all Japanese air and sea forces, fly through the 16 stages of play, and make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 of these stages consist of an air-to-sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as the stage boss), while 5 stages consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese bombers with a mother bomber at the end.\r\n\r\nAs in 1942, players pilot a P-38 Lightning. Controls are also similar: button 1 fires main weapons, and button two performs two special actions: a loop maneuver like in 1942, or one of three special attacks in exchange for some of the player's fuel. Indeed, players now have only one life, in the form of a large \"fuel\" meter; constantly depleting, but refillable by collecting various powerups (chiefly \"Pow\" icons). In 2-player mode, when both players overlap their planes on screen, the energy bar can be transferred from the player with more fuel to the player with less. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a new main weapon.\r\n\r\nThere are cheat codes, different for every stage, ranging from holding down a fire button or pointing the joystick in certain direction, player(s) are rewarded with fully upgraded weapons.","Genres":{"genre":"Shooter"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"Yes","Publisher":"Capcom","Developer":"Capcom","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/23253-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"400","height":"407","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/23253-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/23253.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"102"}}}},"1966 Batman by Macbee v1.0 (PD)":{},"1y by Trilobit (PAL) (PD)":{},"2-Frame Flicker Palette Demo (br-gr) by strfr (2007) (PD)":{},"2-Frame Flicker Palette Demo (gm-by) by strfr (2007) (PD)":{},"2-Frame Flicker Palette Demo (rb-gb) by strfr (2007) (PD)":{},"2-Frame Flicker Palette Demo (rb-gk) by strfr (2007) (PD)":{},"2-Frame Flicker Palette Demo (rc-by) by strfr (2007) (PD)":{},"2-Frame Flicker Palette Demo (rc-gm) by strfr (2007) (PD)":{},"2-Frame Flicker Palette Demo (rg-bg) by strfr (2007) (PD)":{},"2-Frame Flicker Palette Demo (rg-bk) by strfr (2007) (PD)":{},"2-Frame Flicker Palette Demo (rk-bg) by strfr (2007) (PD)":{},"2009 Fireworks Demo by Matrixz (Fixed by blargg) (PD)":{},"2009 Fireworks Demo by Matrixz (PD)":{},"21-Emon - Mezase Hotel Ou!!":{"id":"29044","GameTitle":"21-Emon","AlternateTitles":{"title":["21エモン","MEZASE HOTEL OU!!","AIM TO BE A HOTEL KING!!"]},"PlatformId":"34","Platform":"TurboGrafx 16","ReleaseDate":"12/16/1994","Overview":"Naturally a manga/TV anime tie-in, 21 Emon is one of those Japanese style board games that have never really made a big impact in the west.

One minute you're shoving several feet of cold steel between the gaping jaws of some evil robot dragon, and the next thing you know, you've been transformed into a fire breathing lizard man. Such is the problem that you first encounter at the beginning of Adventure Island, Hudson Soft's conversion of the Master System game 'Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap'. Taking more of its influence from the second game in the Wonder Boy series than the first, Adventure Island has a more balanced structure and more exploratory gameplay.\r\n\r\nThe main game is centred around a small village which acts as a sort of 'hub' to the surrounding levels. Each of these levels are gradually accessed over time with the acquisition of keys or new transformations. As the game progresses, you will find yourself transforming into five different creatures, which can (and need to) be switched between in special rooms. The lizard is the basic transformation and does little more than breathe fire at any passing fauna. Mouse man is a tiny little critter and aside from being able to fit under small obstacles, he can also run up and around special chequered walls and ceilings. Next up is a green amphibian that gives you the power to swim around freely, followed by a tiger man who swings his sword around in a wide arc, allowing you to break blocks above and below. Finally, there is the bird transformation which lets you fly around by repeatedly tapping the jump button.\r\n\r\nAs you progress, your quest will take you over many types of terrain from jungle to desert to the inside of a giant pyramid - but to help you out there is a password/backup save feature in a church in the main village. As you viciously hack up the cute little inhabitants of the island, you find that they considerately drop money and helpful items for you. The money is used in shops to upgrade your armour, or buy healing at the hospital, while the other items are special weapons that can be set from the pause menu. These include homing fireballs, ground based mini whirlwinds and arrows that shoot directly upwards (and are a blessing when you are trying to get rid of flame-dropping clouds).","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":{"genre":["Adventure","Platform"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","Developer":"Westone","Rating":"10","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"36286","PlatformId":"4929"},{"id":"32242","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"14164","PlatformId":"4"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/33520-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"400","height":"399","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/33520-1.jpg"}}}},"Adventures of Batman and Robin Title Screen by Macbee 1.0 (PD)":{},"Adventures of Lex & Grim, The (PD)":{},"Adventures of Tomley Kleene Demo by Bob Rost (PD)":{},"Adventures of Tomley Kleene by Bob Rost (PD)":{},"Aero Blasters":{"id":"4909","GameTitle":"Aero Blasters","AlternateTitles":{"title":"Air Buster"},"PlatformId":"34","Platform":"TurboGrafx 16","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1990","Overview":"The player controls a small craft through different levels with many enemies.

There is precious little strategy - even less than Space Harrier, and often luck plays more of a part than skill. The action is split up by the occasional bonus stage - a run through a canyon blowing up anything that dares to exist in front of you.

The game is divided up into different areas, each represented by a map screen. Within these areas, you can choose your route to the end (by exiting levels at certain points). Throughout each area you have to find a 'master key' allowing you access to the boss - this can be hard to locate at times and requires lots of shooting at blank areas of screen just in case.\r\n\r\nControl of your character is original - on each stage you have three characters which you can choose between, with the CPU controlled ones following behind you like some bizarre congo line. The characters are preset and vary from stage to stage, and each one has different attributes. For example, some have very high jumping ability, whereas others are poor at jumping but have spread-shot weapons. Once you have found the master key and reached the final level in the area, you are entered into a boss battle, where you sit astride the titular donkey and attempt to fight your way to the next area.","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Platform"]},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Hudson","Developer":"Hudson","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/20230-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"467","height":"471","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/20230-1.jpg"}}}},"Appare Gateball":{"id":"20231","GameTitle":"Appare!

First up is the choice between action and simulation mode. The main difference that I can make out between the two is that in action mode you have to both aim the shot and set the power, in simulation only the shot aiming is required. Your game is played out in two teams, rather than two individuals, and the members of your team are chosen from a variety of weird and crazy looking characters with varying attributes. Shots are aimed in a simple overhead viewpoint, which then switches to a standard view for the execution of the shot itself.

It can be fiddly at first, but it's essential that you master it.\r\n\r\nThe four weapons available are variable in quality. The forward shot and diagonal shot are both only useful when you've lost the other weapons, as the missile and full-fire are the ones that you will utilise most often. The missile is particularly useful as in some levels you are required to blast away areas of wall to progress. Levels are varied - some are horizontal, some are more like mazes and there are also two types of boss area: one with a small enemy over the opposite side of the screen protected by a barrier you have to destroy, and another with a huge mechanical monster that follows you relentlessly around an arena.","Genres":{"genre":"Shooter"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"UPL","Developer":"UPL","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/20235-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"468","height":"471","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/20235-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/20235.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"123"}}}},"Attack Force (PD)":{},"Attack Force V0.8 (PD)":{},"Audio Latency Test by Blargg (PD)":{},"Av Poker":{"id":"20236","GameTitle":"AV Poker: World Gambler","PlatformId":"34","Platform":"TurboGrafx 16","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1992","Overview":"Unlicensed PC Engine release by Games Express.

The puzzle-based action in Lode Runner is simple: You are presented with a side-view platforms-and-ladders based level and you have to collect all the gold and escape without getting caught by the baddies. To defend yourself, you can dig holes in the ground, either to the left or to the right, and enemies stumbling upon them will fall down and be trapped. If you time it right, the hole will re-fill before the enemy can climb out, forcing them to respawn elsewhere in the level. If you prefer evasive action, make sure the coast is clear so you can escape up a ladder or across a well-placed rope, but be warned - they will follow! Once you have collected all the gold, hotfoot it to the nearest long ladder and escape out the top of the screen.

Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen \"Columns\"\r\n\r\nWhile a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.\r\n\r\nIf, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel Column appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.\r\n\r\nThe columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with Jewels.\r\n\r\nSome ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. \"Flash columns\" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. \"Doubles\" allows two players work together in the same well. \"Time trial\" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sega","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"7","Game":[{"id":"33307","PlatformId":"4929"},{"id":"37991","PlatformId":"24"},{"id":"5738","PlatformId":"20"},{"id":"465","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"3085","PlatformId":"35"},{"id":"29108","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"34519","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/23255-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"645","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/23255-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/23255.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"128"}}}},"Columns by Sivak (PD)":{},"Concentration Room V.01 by Damian Yerrick (PD)":{},"Concentration Room V.02 by Damian Yerrick (PD)":{},"Contra 4 Title Screen Demake by Macbee v1.0 (PD)":{},"Controller Ports 2012 by KHS (PD)":{},"Controller Queue by Shay Green (PD)":{},"Copper Bars Demo by Quietust (PD)":{},"Coryoon - Child of Dragon":{"id":"18403","GameTitle":"Coryoon","PlatformId":"34","Platform":"TurboGrafx 16","ReleaseDate":"11/29/1991","Overview":"Horizontal shoot 'em up that casts you as a baby dragon out to free a princess from the clutches of an evil....well, you get the idea.

Simply flying a ship into outer space simply wasn't going to cut it anymore. Taito had an idea. Yes, there was still a spaceship. And yeah, that \"outer space\" part was still there too. But instead of the usual aliens, you fought fish.\r\n\r\nYes, fish.\r\n\r\nNot even regular, aquatic fish, but robotic fish with lasers equipped to their fins, giant metal teeth and missiles firing from their gills. And not just fish either. There are squid, snails, and other undersea variations out for your blood as well.\r\n\r\nThe requisite plot is about the people of the planet Darius, who are being terrorized by said intergalatic fish. Only the heroic pilots Proco Jr and Tiat Young can save the day. The constant star of the Darius series is the Silver Hawk. Much like Gradius, it has a primary, forward firing weapon, along with bombs that can be used to attack vertically, and the usual shield.\r\n\r\nThe arcade game Darius games also used a unique system that attached three monitors together to create one massive horizontal playing field (also used in Taito's Ninja Warriors.) Naturally, this couldn't quite be replicated on the console system, so that nifty little gimmick is lost, but emulators can still replicate the dimensions of the screen, even if you end up looking at a tiny picture.\r\n\r\nLooking to further set itself apart from the crowd, every Darius game has multiple levels, with several branching paths throughout the game. It adds tremendously to the replay value, especially since there are usual multiple endings, depending on which final zone you end up at.\r\n\r\nDarius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen was three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet used an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.\r\n\r\nWhen various ports of it were made for different consoles, Taito (and others) were forced to shrink the playfield to fit on one screen.\r\n\r\nIt was released for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, PC Engine, PC Engine (Super CD-ROM), Wii (Virtual Console), and ZX Spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe PC Engine saw three releases:  \r\n\r\nDarius Alpha (1990): A very rare beta release. This is one of the rarest Hu-Cards ever published. You could only get a copy of this hardcore shoot-em-up by buying Darius Plus and Super Darius and then mailing coupons to the publisher. 800 copies were made available, and names were drawn from those who mailed their info in. Some copies of the game were also given away as prizes by PC Engine Gekken and Marakatsu magazines.\r\n\r\nDarius Plus (1990): The full game itself, again a PC Engine HuCard. The bosses that were removed in Alpha do not return here. Both Alpha and Plus were actually written for the PC Engine SuperGrafx and playing them on that console results in slightly improved graphics (less flicker and slowdown).\r\n\r\nSuper Darius (1990): A conversion of Darius for the PC Engine's Super CD-ROM, very close to the original arcade version other than being single-screen. Features new bosses, as well as a \"boss rush\" mode.","Genres":{"genre":"Shooter"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"NEC","Developer":"Taito","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/27093-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"800","height":"800","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/27093-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/27093-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"640","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27093-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/27093-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"542"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/27093-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/27093-2.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"560"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/27093-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/27093-3.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"560"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/27093-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/27093-4.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"560"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/27093-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/27093-5.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"560"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/27093-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/27093-6.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"560"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/27093-6.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/27093-7.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"560"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/27093-7.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/27093-8.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"560"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/27093-8.jpg"}]}},"Darkwing Duck":{"id":"8201","GameTitle":"Darkwing Duck","PlatformId":"34","Platform":"TurboGrafx 16","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1992","Overview":"The kingpins of crime are at it again!

The player takes control of the OF-1, a powerful Orbit Fighter ship codenamed Daidalos on a mission to annihilate the Moon defense system which suddenly went out of control. The rather unique feature of Image Fight is the \"simulation mode\" (called 'Image Fight') that precedes the \"real battle\" (called 'Real Fight'). The game counts a grand total of eight zones - the first five are Combat Training Stages and happen in a virtual space where the player must at least achieve a whooping 90% destruction ratio. If successful, the Real Combat reveals itself and the player gets launched in outer space and fly through three more stages. Just like with any traditional shooter, the ship can be upgraded by collecting flying capsules. They come in two flavors - the first are colored pods (blue and red) which hang around the ship and either fire straight ahead or in the opposite direction the fighter is facing. Those pods can also be thrown at the enemies to inflict more damage. The other kind are various devices that attach at the front of the ship and greatly improve its fire power - they include Bubble lasers, Homing Lasers, V Lasers or the powerful Drill Laser. Sadly, only one can be collected at the same time and the only way to dispose of them is to get hit. Finally, the speed of the ship can be adjusted anytime during the game and the resulting blast of energy can even be used to damage enemy ships.","Genres":{"genre":"Shooter"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Hudson","Developer":"Irem","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"38795","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"1856","PlatformId":"7"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/32835-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"400","height":"387","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/32835-1.jpg"}}}},"Impossamole":{},"Improved 400+ Color Palette Demo by Blargg (PD)":{},"Interlace Demo 1 by Chris Covell (PD)":{},"Interlace Demo 2 by Chris Covell (PD)":{},"Interlace Demo 3 by Chris Covell (PD)":{},"Interlace Demo 4 by Chris Covell (PD)":{},"Invaders Must Die! by Sebastian Mihai (PD)":{},"Ishan's 2nd PCE Demo (PD)":{},"It's-a-me, Mario!

She sets out equipped with her ofuda tags and oharai wand, her only weapons. Sayo can fire at her enemies, but unique to Kiki Kaikai is Sayo's ability to repel enemy fire and bash enemies away with her oharai wand. There are also other power-ups, such as increased firepower, the ability to stop time, and explosive bombs to help Sayo in her journey. Like many games of this kind, Sayo can only take one hit before falling over. The object of each level is to collect a key that opens the passage way to the boss. After that, you must get to the boss' room and fight it. The game is pretty far from a cakewalk. Although it controls well, you can only fire in the direction that you're moving and can't strafe. Unfortunately this applies to all of the other Kiki Kaikai games as well.

The game is based on the popular manga and anime series of the same name, Maison Ikkoku.\r\n\r\nThe story is a bitter-sweet comedic romance involving a group of madcap people who live in a boarding house in 1980s Tokyo. The story focuses primarily on the gradual developing relationships between Yusaku Godai, a poor student down on his luck, and Kyoko Otonashi, a young, recently-widowed boarding house manager.\r\n\r\nIn the game, you take the role of Godai performing various missions that deal with the storyline of Maison Ikkoku. You have to avoid Yotsuya's pranks, save money to throw a party, proclaim your love for Kyoko and other things. The action takes place all over Tokeizaka and not just the boarding house.

Hipopo is armed with water bombs which can be thrown at enemies to soak and damage them. Once soaked, the enemies can then be kicked and destroyed completely. Enemies left unkicked however will dry out and recover after a short period of time.\r\n\r\nThe level design presents moving platforms, collapsible floors, boats and water-wheels all making an appearance.

Well now is your chance to live the dream in Populous, Bullfrog's seminal god game. Domination is the aim here - you control a community of cute little guys and must build a population greater than your computer controlled rival. Starting with a house or two, you are at first limited to raising and lowering the ground - the flatter the ground around a domicile, the more advanced it becomes, up to the level of a sturdy fort. But this is not the extent of your power. More houses mean more people, and more people means the higher your little arrow creeps along your power bar, opening up such furious skills to inflict on your opponent like floods, swamps and volcanoes that disrupt the landscape and any city planning therein. Once you feel you have sufficiently dominated the opposition (the display on the top right conveniently gives you a visual guide here) then you release armageddon - all followers gather together and duke it out until there is only one.

Due to a series of mysterious events, the town of Chany's Hill has been cut off from the rest of the world. People have suddenly gone missing and cannibalistic monsters now roam the land, killing all who cross their path. The protagonist of the game is Laila Arufon, the youngest female member of the S-SWAT (Supernatural and Special Weapon Attack Team). She was born in the small town and has developped strange psychic abilities. Her Psychic Seal (\"PS\") and Mind Force (\"MF\") powers allow her to increase any weapon destruction power but also to increase her defense capability greatly. Her mission is twofold - she must investigate the mysterious and supernatural incident in Chaneys Hill and to rescue all the remaining survivors she can find and lead them to the town's church. Laila comes equipped with a combat knife and a Hand Gun (SIG/SAUER P226) - additional weapons appear later in the game including the Assault Rifle (STYER AUG), Grenade launcher (HK MZP1), Flamethrower (M2A1-7), Bazooka (M72A2) and so forth. Although most of the game uses a traditional top-down view, battles quickly drop the game into side-scrolling action phases. There, Laila fights hordes of monsters to gain experience (blue orbs), life (reb orbs), MF points (green orbs) or ammunitions (pink cases). She can also escape at anytime as long as she can reach the edge of the fighting area. The combat items are complemented by more conventional inventory items such as medic packs, psychic pills, keys and so forth. Player's progression is saved through a long password system.","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Victor Musical Industries, Inc.","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/39787-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"412","height":"400","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/39787-1.jpg"}}}},"ShockMan":{},"Shoot Demo (PD)":{},"ShootNES by Norman B.

It follows the adventures of a young farmer as he travels across a country full of dangers. He carries around a long stick which he slyly uses to take down his enemies. He has a few more tricks up his sleeves - thanks to his magic book (press 'Run' and select a weapon by pressing 'up' and 'down'), he can also shoot blasts of energy from it. However, this technique depletes some of his magic energy which he has to refill periodically. But his ultimate weapon is the ability to turn into a powerful topless fighter - this technique is however only available for the toughest boss encounters located at the end of each area. In this form, our hero can use a powerful chain-whip (which consumes magic energy) to land more punishing blows than his bare fists. Throughout the game, various enemies drop magic orbs when defeated which range from power-ups (red P), increase max-life (green P), increase magic bar (green M), freeze time clocks, bombs, life potions and so forth. Each defeated enemy also drop money that can later be used to purchase life and magic from town people located at the end of each area. This is also where the stick can be later upgraded into a more lethal spear. Finally, infinite continues are available.","Genres":{"genre":"Platform"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/38179-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"415","height":"418","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/38179-1.jpg"}}}},"Tatsujin":{"id":"32833","GameTitle":"Tatsujin","AlternateTitles":{"title":"Truxton"},"PlatformId":"34","Platform":"TurboGrafx 16","ReleaseDate":"07/24/1992","Overview":"Tatsujin is a vertical shooter by Taito and conversion of Toaplan arcade game originally released in 1988.

The space fighter comes equipped with a default Vulcan gun (Power shots) and two more weapons are available for the taking - the blue lock-on lasers (Thunder Laser) and green blasts of energy (Tatsujin Beam). The only way to increase the active weapon's firepower is to collect Power Boosters special flying pods leave behind. Although five boosters are necessary to trigger a power-up upgrade and boost up the strength of the current weapon, special red flashing power icons bring it up to maximum power in no time. Each weapon can be powered up to three times for maximum collateral damage and smart bombs in the shape of monstrous skull-faced energy blasts can be unleashed to kill most enemies on screen.

Once you get to the indoor sections you will find big enemies with the ability to kill you with one hit, in sections set on multiple levels complete with stairways.","Genres":{"genre":"Fighting"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"NEC","Developer":"Capcom","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"36484","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"7543","PlatformId":"40"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/5683-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1521","height":"2156","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/5683-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/5683-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1524","height":"2156","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/5683-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/5683.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"156"}}}},"Time Conquest V1 by _Demo_ and EFX (PD)":{},"Time Conquest V2 by _Demo_ and EFX (PD)":{},"Time Conquest V2x by _Demo_ and EFX (PD)":{},"Time Conquest Vx by _Demo_ and EFX (PD)":{},"Time Cruise":{"id":"8238","GameTitle":"Time Cruise","PlatformId":"34","Platform":"TurboGrafx 16","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1992","Overview":"Time Cruise is a futuristic pinball game, developed by Sankindo and published by Face, which was released in 1992.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"FACE","Developer":"Sankindo","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/8238-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"500","height":"600","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/8238-1.jpg"}}}},"Time Latency Test by Blargg (PD)":{},"Timeball":{},"Tiny Toon Adventures Title Screen Remake by Macbee v1.0 (PD)":{},"Titan":{"id":"35970","GameTitle":"Titan","AlternateTitles":{"title":"タイタン"},"PlatformId":"34","Platform":"TurboGrafx 16","ReleaseDate":"03/15/1991","Overview":"A twist on the Breakout theme, Titan has you bounce one or many balls around a maze, nudging them to alter direction, to clear away all the blocks.","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Puzzle"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P296ecdhAQ8","Publisher":"Titus","Developer":"Naxat Soft","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"24646","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"27320","PlatformId":"7"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/35970-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/35970-1.jpg"},"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/35970-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"350","height":"350","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/35970-1.jpg"}},"banner":{"_":"graphical/35970-g.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/35970-1.jpg","$":{"width":"750","height":"669"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/35970-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/35970-2.jpg","$":{"width":"767","height":"669"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/35970-2.jpg"}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/35970.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"139"}}}},"Toadman 7 Color Demake v1.0 by Macbee (PD)":{},"ToeJam & Earl Title Screen (PD)":{},"Toilet Kids":{"id":"28974","GameTitle":"Toilet Kids","PlatformId":"34","Platform":"TurboGrafx 16","ReleaseDate":"03/06/1992","Genres":{"genre":"Shooter"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"Yes","Publisher":"Media Rings","Developer":"Bits Laboratory","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/28974-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1765","height":"1377","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/28974-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/28974-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"400","height":"400","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/28974-1.jpg"}}]}},"Tokumaru Raycaster 00 (PD)":{},"Tokumaru Raycaster 01 (PD)":{},"Tommy T's Play Me Sound Editor (PD)":{},"Tori PCM-Anime Demo by NES Hack Factory (PD)":{},"Toshi Tensou Keikaku - Eternal City":{},"Tower of Druaga, The - Druaga no Tou":{},"Toy Shop Boys":{"id":"37260","GameTitle":"Toy Shop Boys","PlatformId":"34","Platform":"TurboGrafx 16","ReleaseDate":"12/14/1990","Overview":"Overhead shoot 'em up featuring all manner of toys as enemies.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":["Platform","Shooter"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Developer":"VICTOR MUSICAL INDUSTRIES","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/37260-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"400","height":"382","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/37260-1.jpg"}}}},"Tri Scale Demo (PD)":{},"Tricky Kick":{"id":"8240","GameTitle":"Tricky Kick","PlatformId":"34","Platform":"TurboGrafx 16","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1990","Overview":"Flex your thumbs and tease your brain!
