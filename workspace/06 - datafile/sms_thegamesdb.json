There are two modes in the championship mode that affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining modes, and cars have roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist. There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too many objects or other cars frequently. \r\n\r\n•Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or wet, only on some circuits).","Genres":{"genre":"Racing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sega","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"20544","PlatformId":"20"},{"id":"14837","PlatformId":"18"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/2697-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1439","height":"2040","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/2697-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/2697-2.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1439","height":"2040","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/2697-2.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/2697.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"137"}}}},"Aztec Adventure - The Golden Road to Paradise":{"id":"2698","GameTitle":"Aztec Adventure","PlatformId":"35","Platform":"Sega Master System","ReleaseDate":"09/20/1987","Overview":"Gameplay involves the player trying to reach Paradise by exploring ten different lands, including desert, marshes, ruins, underground waterways, and forest.

It is a port of an MSX game of the same name, and is largely identical due to the similar hardware between the two machines. Due to the decline of the SG-1000 and emergence of the Sega Master System, the game was not released in Europe or Australia like many other SG-1000 games.\r\n\r\nThe Castle was the last SG-1000 game to be released commercially by Sega on a cart, and the only SG-1000 to adopt packaging more akin to Sega Mark III games. The Black Onyx would be the very last SG-1000 game to be released by Sega, but this would be on card.\r\n\r\nThe game has a fairly standard plot of rescuing a princess from a castle, though the game itself was considered very large for the time. It also contains a map system similar to that of later Metroid and Castlevania games.\r\n\r\nThe Castle was followed by the MSX/NES game Castle Excellent later in the year.

Forget the passage of time and tickle your mind with this brilliant game of strategy and skill.\r\n\r\nThe game takes place inside a tall, rectangular playing area. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen \"Columns\"\r\nWhile a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.\r\nIf, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.\r\nOccasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.\r\nThe columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with symbols.\r\nSome ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. \"Flash columns\" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. \"Doubles\" allows two players work together in the same well. \"Time trial\" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sega","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"7","Game":[{"id":"33307","PlatformId":"4929"},{"id":"37991","PlatformId":"24"},{"id":"5738","PlatformId":"20"},{"id":"465","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"29108","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"34519","PlatformId":"6"},{"id":"23255","PlatformId":"34"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/3085-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1521","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/3085-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/3085-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1530","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/3085-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/3085.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"128"}}}},"Comic Bakery":{},"Comical Machine Gun Joe":{"id":"26439","GameTitle":"Comical Machine Gun Joe","AlternateTitles":{"title":["コミカル マシンガン ジョー","Machine Gun Joe"]},"PlatformId":"35","Platform":"Sega Master System","ReleaseDate":"04/21/1986","Overview":"This game was originally released only in Japan on Sega Card, though has appeared in several compilations since.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sega","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/26439-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"785","height":"1090","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/26439-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/26439-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"785","height":"1090","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/26439-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/26439.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"79"}}}},"Complete Arcade Pack Collection, The":{},"Congo Bongo":{"id":"36629","GameTitle":"Congo Bongo","AlternateTitles":{"title":"コンゴボンゴ"},"PlatformId":"4949","Platform":"SEGA SG-1000","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1983","Overview":"Congo Bongo, originally known as Tip Top, is a 1983 arcade platformer game developed by Sega.

It is a platform-based puzzle game, where a penguin must guide an egg down the screen making sure not to break it.\r\n\r\nThe basic aim of Doki Doki Penguin Land is to guide an egg from the top of the screen to the bottom. To do so means digging downwards, making sure it does not smash in the process. As a puzzle-platformer, everything is affected by gravity, and if the egg falls from a great height, it will smash. Success is achieved by making your way down the playfield carefully.\r\n\r\nYou control a penguin. 1 jumps, 2 digs. The penguin can push the egg left or right, and can jump on it to make sure it doesn't get stuck against a wall. Digging affects the tile one block left (or right) and one block down away from the penguin's position, meaning it is impossible to dig straight downwards. If the egg gets into a position where it cannot be moved left or right, jumping and landing on it will cause it to smash.\r\n\r\nThe penguin cannot be damaged, but can be temporarily stunned, the objective being to protect the egg, not necessarily yourself. If the player leaves the screen from the bottom he/she will emerge from the top.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Pony Canyon","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/36630-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"754","height":"1040","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/36630-1.jpg"}}}},"Double Dragon":{"id":"2883","GameTitle":"Double Dragon","PlatformId":"35","Platform":"Sega Master System","ReleaseDate":"07/01/1987","Overview":"The game is divided into four different stages or \"missions\", which consist of a city slum, a factory, the woods, and the hideout of the boss.

Bin has six levels to clear before he can rescue Lucy from Archaca's clutches.","Genres":{"genre":"Fighting"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sega","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"9589","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"28970","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"32001","PlatformId":"40"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/2735-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1521","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/2735-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/2735-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1530","height":"2100","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/2735-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/2735.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"250"}}}},"Dynamite Headdy":{"id":"2736","GameTitle":"Dynamite Headdy","PlatformId":"35","Platform":"Sega Master System","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1994","Overview":"Dynamite Headdy is a 2D Platformer game, developed by Minato Giken and published by Tec Toy, which was released in South America in 1994.","Genres":{"genre":"Platform"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Tec Toy","Developer":"Minato Giken","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"21445","PlatformId":"9"},{"id":"25101","PlatformId":"20"},{"id":"4351","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"6245","PlatformId":"36"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/2736-1.png","$":{"side":"back","width":"476","height":"680","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/2736-1.png"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/2736-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"546","height":"770","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/2736-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/2736.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"175"}}}},"E-SWAT - City Under Siege":{},"E.I. - Exa Innova":{},"Eagles 5":{},"Earthworm Jim":{"id":"2892","GameTitle":"Earthworm Jim","PlatformId":"35","Platform":"Sega Master System","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1994","Overview":"The storyline involves many colorful characters.

One day, in the space above Earth, the evil Psy-Crow had cornered a rebel spaceship pilot who had stolen an \"Ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit\" built by Professor Monkey-for-a-Head. The suit had been commissioned by the evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt so that she could further conquer the galaxy. In the ensuing space fight, the suit was dropped to Earth, and fell on Jim. By a stroke of luck, Jim managed to land within the collar of the suit, and it ended up mutating him into the large and intelligent (at least by earthworm standards) superhero he is today.","Genres":{"genre":"Adventure"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Playmates","Developer":"Shiny Entertainment","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"7","Game":[{"id":"18810","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"3414","PlatformId":"5"},{"id":"10728","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"25102","PlatformId":"20"},{"id":"4353","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"2894","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"997","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/2892-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/2892-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/2892-1.png","$":{"side":"back","width":"478","height":"680","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/2892-1.png"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/2892-2.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"535","height":"764","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/2892-2.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/2892.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"175"}}}},"Ecco the Dolphin":{"id":"2898","GameTitle":"Ecco the Dolphin","PlatformId":"35","Platform":"Sega Master System","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1993","Overview":"The gameplay is essentially side-scrolling, with horizontal, diagonal and vertical movement.

Players can perform a purely aesthetic spin in the air when jumping out of the water. Two features of the game played on actual dolphin habits; one button causes Ecco to sing, allowing him to speak with other cetaceans and interact with certain objects. The same button is used for echolocation; holding it down would cause the song to return, generating a map of the area. Additionally, Ecco, being a mammal, has to surface periodically for air, or else find an air vent. If the \"air meter\" ran out, Ecco would lose health rapidly-this represented drowning.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Adventure"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Novotrade","Rating":"8","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"132","PlatformId":"21"},{"id":"27366","PlatformId":"20"},{"id":"2900","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"6247","PlatformId":"36"}]},"Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/2898-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/2898-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/2898-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/2898-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/2898-3.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/2898-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/2898-4.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/2898-4.jpg"}],"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/2898-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"720","height":"1026","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/2898-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/2898-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"728","height":"1026","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/2898-1.jpg"}}],"banner":{"_":"graphical/2898-g.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/2898.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"114"}}}},"Ecco the Dolphin - Tides of Time":{"id":"3097","GameTitle":"Ecco: The Tides of Time","PlatformId":"35","Platform":"Sega Master System","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1995","Overview":"The evil Vortex has returned and Ecco faces a dangerous adventure.

It was released in 1985 exclusively in Japan.\r\n\r\nGameplay in this \"8-bit\" version of GP World is similar in concept to the arcade GP World but given the wildly differing hardware, different in execution. Most notably all graphics in the game are generated in real-time by the SG-1000 rather than streamed from a LaserDisc, which in turn leads to more predictable car physics. The concept of racing in four different types of GP is scrapped, replaced instead with a GP that spans the world and three selectable difficulties.\r\n\r\nLike the original, the game uses a third person perspective similar to the likes of Turbo (although the camera is positioned behind the steering wheel), and sees the player race in a formula one car, navigating the course and avoiding other drivers. This version is also notable for having a simplistic track editor. It is likely that the SH-400 controller was designed with this game in mind.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Racing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Pony Canyon","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"12254","PlatformId":"23"}},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/35146-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"2182","height":"3065","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/35146-1.jpg"}}}},"Gaegujangi Kkachi":{},"Gain Ground":{"id":"2751","GameTitle":"Gain Ground","PlatformId":"35","Platform":"Sega Master System","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1991","Overview":"Gain Ground became a sensation overnight as the newest human vs. Android competition.

He/she can speed up and slow down and two players may play at the same time.\r\n\r\nMonaco GP was Sega's last arcade game to use discrete logic circuits rather than a digital CPU, meaning it cannot be emulated in emulators such as MAME. The player's score and time are also displayed on external LED displays, so it is impossible to re-create the game perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe game only was ported to the Sega SG-1000 in 1983. The SG-1000 version had a difficulty select of one, two, or three other cars on the road. It was quickly followed by Pro Monaco GP which uses similar hardware, but the series would not reach its peak until 1989's Super Monaco GP. The game was, however, included in the Japanese release of the Sega Saturn compilation Sega Ages Memorial Selection Vol: 2.

This is probably the very first instance of a recall in Sega's history (?).\r\n\r\nAs of 2013, a recent auction of the game on Yahoo Japan was won for ¥113,500, but it has been known to sell upwards from ¥200,000.\r\n\r\nThe bug was fixed and the game was re-released a few weeks later as a \"sequel\", Pachinko II, which is much more common.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sega","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"22871","PlatformId":"4927"}},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/36649-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"426","height":"599","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/36649-1.jpg"}}}},"Pachinko II":{"id":"36650","GameTitle":"Pachinko II","AlternateTitles":{"title":"パチンコⅡ"},"PlatformId":"4949","Platform":"SEGA SG-1000","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1984","Overview":"Pachinko II is the sequel to Pachinko, and was released for the SG-1000 in 1984.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sega","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/36650-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"418","height":"600","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/36650-1.jpg"}}}},"Page Frame Register Detect V0.01 by Eric R.

Occasionally cylindrical platforms appear on the edge of the screen, which when jumped on, will take Q*bert to the top.\r\n\r\nThe SG-1000 port is a very bare-bones rendition of the game and is missing many elements seen in the arcade version. It is also much harder as the port sends out more enemies in the first few levels.\r\n\r\nInterestingly it is one of the only ports of the game that does not respond to the Left, Up, Right and Down inputs - only UpLeft, UpRight, DownRight, and DownLeft.\r\n\r\nEventually this game would see a sequel on a Sega console, also called Q*bert.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Tsukuda Original","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"14","Game":[{"id":"15080","PlatformId":"23"},{"id":"5318","PlatformId":"22"},{"id":"5196","PlatformId":"26"},{"id":"4014","PlatformId":"31"},{"id":"7328","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"25966","PlatformId":"32"},{"id":"22877","PlatformId":"4927"},{"id":"36204","PlatformId":"4929"},{"id":"2021","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"23339","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"22056","PlatformId":"41"},{"id":"4200","PlatformId":"16"},{"id":"5477","PlatformId":"10"},{"id":"37872","PlatformId":"4953"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/36652-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"424","height":"600","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/36652-1.jpg"}}}},"Quartet":{"id":"2983","GameTitle":"Quartet","AlternateTitles":{"title":"Double Target"},"PlatformId":"35","Platform":"Sega Master System","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1987","Overview":"If you hate aliens, you'll love Quartet!

It is not a port of any specific version of Street Fighter II, but rather it is a mix between the Mega Drive versions of Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition and Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, mixing elements from both. The title itself, Street Fighter II′, features the same blue fonts as the Champion Edition logo, as well as the prime symbol (′) next to the numeral, which is pronounced Dash in Japan, but is usually unspoken overseas.\r\n\r\nThough severely watered down due to the weaker hardware of the SMS, this version of Street Fighter II is still a reasonably faithful rendition of the game. It also features the announcer's vocals which the Mega Drive's Special Champion Edition lacked. However, the game is held back by a lack of moves (the Master System only has two buttons on its controller, as opposed to the six used in the arcade game) and character voice samples, and the framerate is low. The music has also been tweaked in places.\r\n\r\nThe SMS version only retains 8 fighters out of the 12 character roster from Special Champion Edition. E. Honda, Zangief, Dhalsim and Vega (Claw) are the four fighters who did not made the cut. None of the additional fighters from New Challengers (Cammy, T. Hawk, Fei-Long and Dee-Jay) are present either, despite the use of character portraits from that version.\r\n\r\nThe character-specific endings are also not present in this version either: instead the ending screen consists of portraits of Balrog, Sagat and M. Bison (the same ones used in Special Champion Edition when the player clears the game using a boss character) with a generic message underneath. The staff roll is also lifted straight from Special Champion Editon, but with the addition of people who worked specifically on this version.","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":{"genre":"Fighting"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Tectoy","Developer":"Capcom","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"6","Game":[{"id":"9508","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"6422","PlatformId":"40"},{"id":"33537","PlatformId":"4929"},{"id":"32565","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"14727","PlatformId":"1"},{"id":"3122","PlatformId":"6"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/3031-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/3031-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/3031-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1130","height":"1622","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/3031-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/3031-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1162","height":"1618","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/3031-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/3031.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"175"}}}},"Street Master":{"id":"26745","GameTitle":"Street Master","AlternateTitles":{"title":"스트리트마스터"},"PlatformId":"35","Platform":"Sega Master System","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1992","Overview":"Street Master is an unlicensed port of Street Fighter I.

When the former is kidnapped by the evil Chimera organization, Saul uses one of his father's inventions to turn himself into a wolf-human hybrid (similar to a werewolf) that may be capable of defeating Chimera.\r\n\r\nWolfchild was designed by Simon Phipps, also responsible for the earlier Switchblade 2, a rather similar game. The action is viewed from the side and scrolls in eight directions. The player must guide Saul through five levels, negotiating platforms and shooting various monsters, the result of Chimera experiments. Initially, the player character is Saul in his normal, human form. Only when enough energy has been collected does he turn into a wolf-human, giving him much better attack techniques.","Co-op":"No","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/38090-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"339","height":"480","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/38090-1.jpg"}}}},"Wonder Boy":{"id":"3106","GameTitle":"Wonder Boy","AlternateTitles":{"title":["wonderboy","WonderBoy"]},"PlatformId":"35","Platform":"Sega Master System","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1987","Overview":"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to set out all alone through the deepest of deep dark forests?\r\n\r\nTo live off the fruit of the land?

Despite this it did not see a release outside of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe arcade version of this game was re-released on the Sega Saturn as part of Irem Arcade Classics.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Racing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Sega","Developer":"Sega","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"26405","PlatformId":"7"}},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/36638-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"378","height":"514","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/36638-1.jpg"}}}},"Zool":{"id":"7510","GameTitle":"Zool: Ninja of the 'Nth' Dimension","AlternateTitles":{"title":"Zool"},"PlatformId":"35","Platform":"Sega Master System","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1993","Overview":"His name is Zool.
