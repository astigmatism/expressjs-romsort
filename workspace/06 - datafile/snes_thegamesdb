It was ported to Nintendo Super Famicom in 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 2100, the Earth's environment is devastated by its inhabitants, who develop their space technology to live on Mars. Before they left, the humans created a Bio-Computer assigned to replenish Earth's ecosystem in hopes of returning to Earth. 50 years after terra-forming parts of Mars, the human colonists were attacked by mysterious, but hostile UFOs. The military leaders among the colonists set up an attack force to defend the colonists using state of the art fighter ships identified as the Icarus. The main operation of attack is called \\\"Acrobat Mission\\\" because it exceeds the technical flying ability of the pilots.\\r\\nIn the arcade version, surviving fighter pilots Jet and Nova are available for the player to choose for the rest of the game, but both were discluded from the Super Famicom port, making the player's pilot anonymous as well as discarding Nova's custom color scheme.\\r\\nHere however is the story, exactly as it appears at the beginning of the game, with spelling and grammar mistakes preserved:\\r\\n\\\"AD 2100: HUMANS EXTERMINATED BY THEIR OWN NATURE DISTRUPTION AND ESCAPE TO MARS LEAVING BIO-COMPUTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RECUPERATION OF EARTH. ONE DAY HALF A CENTURY AFTER HUMANS ARRIVED, MARS WAS ATTACKED BY STRANGE FLYING OBJECTES. TO FIGHT THESE ENEMIES, THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE DEFENCE AGENCY ORGANIZED THE TASK FORCE ARMY AND STARTED THE DOG FIGHT WITH INVADERS QUICLY. THE OPERATION WAS CALLED \\\"ACROBAT MISSION\\\" AS IT EXCEEDED THE PILOT'S TECHNICAL LIMIT.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayers started the game equipped with the default weapon, the Standard Shot: a semi-automatic laser weapon. Though moderately powerful, the Standard Shot cannot be upgraded or charged. Once the player has lost a significant number of lives and their selected weapon his lost its upgrades, the Standard Shot will once again take over.\\r\\nTwo other weapons are selectable to the player, one of which is the Wave Shot (announced as Wide in the Arcade version). The Wave Shot is a spread shot that increases in size, numbers and strength. When charged, the Wave Shot can unleash a short range, but powerful laser blast that increases in width and strength when Wave icons are collected. The other weapon was the Hurricane Shot, a unique area-effect weapon that encircles the ship clockwise when fired before flying forward. When charged, the Hurricane Shot fires a ball of energy across the screen, but there is a one second delay every time the shot is fired.\\r\\nThe player also had Bombs although unlike many shooters, the player can only hold up to two bombs. Once collected however, the two bombs get physically mounted under the ship's wings. If an enemy shot hits one of the bombs, then the bomb will detonate, creating a destructive shield for the player. The player can manually detonate either bomb at will.\\r\\nThe player's Icarus fighter ship has a number of defenses at its disposal as well. Whenever the player moves their ship in any given direction, a burst of flame from the ship's jet exhaust will shoot out from the opposite direction the player moves the ship in. This applies to all directions: left, right, front, back and all four diagonal angles.

On start-up the player would enter a name, selected either a male or female character avatar, and then move the avatar around a virtual town. Houses and shops in the town served as download locations where the player could directly download games, particular game data, or digital magazines. The download would write game data into temporary memory locations which would remain until the player downloaded a new game to take its place.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from downloads, players could also travel to in-game locations such as the Wall Newspaper Co.

Furthermore, the avatar was equipped with an inventory and game currency which could be spent on various in-game items such as telephone cards, vehicle tickets, fish bait, and shoes that would enable the player to dash rather than walk everywhere.

Characters have HP, MP (SP for fighter characters), EXP, equipment, stats and class-specific, SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs. The player can explore his surroundings, talk to people and visit shops when not in battle, though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to leave the current area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game's core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties, which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating turns so that each party can move once and/or attack once a turn. Attacks are divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former, a party uses a special ability (e.g. casting fireballs, throwing lightning, healing allies) of one of its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same ability, they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat results in less money and generally less damage, but the target cannot retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice, etc. Close-up, each unit in two adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES combat, they can attack an enemy, use an item or a special ability (though these can't be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend.\\r\\n\\r\\nDragons are the player's ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain experience like normal characters do. In battle, each party has a dragon attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its dragon: if a party's dragon is slain, the party will lose the ability to use special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map. The beast acts as a very powerful autonomous unit that moves after its party does and it cannot be controlled beyond very simple commands, e.g. \\\"Come!\\\" Out of battle, dragons will eat anything and raising them by feeding them items is an important part of the game. Feeding can improve their stats as well as affect their behavior on the field, and the dragons develop into new forms as they grow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe player can change the characters in each of the parties, their formation as well as what dragon represents them at will.\",\"ESRB\":\"E10+ - Everyone 10+\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":[\"Role-Playing\",\"Strategy\"]},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Squaresoft\",\"Developer\":\"Squaresoft\",\"Rating\":\"6\",\"Images\":{\"fanart\":[{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/9054-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/9054-1.jpg\"},{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/9054-2.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/9054-2.jpg\"},{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/9054-3.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1280\",\"height\":\"720\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/9054-3.jpg\"},{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/9054-4.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1280\",\"height\":\"720\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/9054-4.jpg\"},{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/9054-5.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/9054-5.jpg\"}],\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/9054-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"573\",\"height\":\"421\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/9054-1.jpg\"}},\"screenshot\":[{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/9054-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"256\",\"height\":\"224\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/9054-1.jpg\"},{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/9054-2.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"256\",\"height\":\"224\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/9054-2.jpg\"}],\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/9054.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"75\"}}}}","Bakukyuu Renpatsu!!

Over the course of the operation, about four million soldiers of the Axis powers invaded the Soviet Union along a 2,900-kilometer (1,800 mi) front, the largest invasion force in the history of warfare.

As the fighters receive punishment, these portraits show injuries such as cuts and bruises, the severity of which indicate the fighter's health (or lack of). There is also a boxing glove shaped meter at the top of the screen, that indicates how much power a boxer has left in his punches (as in a real fight, the more punches boxers throw, the more tired they become, resulting in weaker punches).\\r\\n \\r\\nThe fighters movement about the ring is limited to side-stepping left or right; it is impossible to step back or forward. A variety of punches can be thrown; left jabs, crosses to the head, hooks to the body, and uppercuts to the head (all punches except jabs can be thrown with either hand). It is also possible to throw a limited number of so-called 'super punches', that are essentially either a right cross or a right uppercut, but with extra power. At the start of each round, each boxer is capable of throwing one super-punch at any time, although it becomes possible to throw one more with each knockdown they score against their opponent. Defensive techniques consist of blocking, dodging, and clinching. Each boxer has three attributes: 'power', 'stamina', and 'chin'.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":[\"Fighting\",\"Sports\"]},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Electro Brain\",\"Developer\":\"Sculptured Software\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"1\",\"Game\":{\"id\":\"4293\",\"PlatformId\":\"18\"}},\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/17856-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/17856-1.jpg\"},\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/17856-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"475\",\"height\":\"347\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/17856-1.jpg\"}},\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/17856.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"184\"}}}}","Brain Lord":"{\"id\":\"1718\",\"GameTitle\":\"Brain Lord\",\"PlatformId\":\"6\",\"Platform\":\"Super Nintendo (SNES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/29/1994\",\"Overview\":\"ARE YOU THE BRAIN LORD?\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond your memory lies a time filled with Dragons and men riding the skies together.

The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Fighting\"},\"Publisher\":\"Sony\",\"Developer\":\"Malibu\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"6\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"1741\",\"PlatformId\":\"7\"},{\"id\":\"18587\",\"PlatformId\":\"4\"},{\"id\":\"4949\",\"PlatformId\":\"21\"},{\"id\":\"24281\",\"PlatformId\":\"20\"},{\"id\":\"4315\",\"PlatformId\":\"18\"},{\"id\":\"37775\",\"PlatformId\":\"36\"}]},\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/2853-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/2853-1.jpg\"},\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/2853-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"2088\",\"height\":\"1512\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/2853-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/2853-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"2096\",\"height\":\"1528\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/2853-1.jpg\"}}],\"clearlogo\":{\"_\":\"clearlogo/2853.png\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"196\"}}}}","Clock Tower":"{\"id\":\"34732\",\"GameTitle\":\"Clock Tower\",\"AlternateTitles\":{\"title\":\"クロックタワー\"},\"PlatformId\":\"6\",\"Platform\":\"Super Nintendo (SNES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"09/14/1995\",\"Overview\":\"Jennifer Simpson and her friends are from Granite Orphanage in Romsdalen, Norway.

In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant \\\"Module\\\" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed \\\"Berserkers\\\". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.\\r\\n\\r\\nCyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind \\\"NeoParts\\\", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.\\r\\n\\r\\nCombat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of \\\"options\\\" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat.

The story´s better, there´s an autobattle, there are even more neoparts, the star map interface is greatly improved, your \\\"inactive\\\" characters are automatically relegated to Support Modules and are able to not only gain combat experience but also use their skills and sometimes even finish battles before they even begin...

The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...\\r\\n\\r\\nGun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer.

The game is based on the 1996 Super GT racing season using the horsepower standards and rules of the era.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring championship mode, the player is asked enter a number, his or her driver's name, and the team name that he or she will use during the championship. The driver's name and team can be entered using either English or Japanese letters. When a player beats a record, he or she is asked to insert his or her number, name or initials (up to four characters and two digits for the number). Championship mode can last for multiple seasons. Playing ninety-nine seasons in a single racing career is theoretically possible due to the double-digit nature of the season information. There are eight different tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit that has been shown in video games since Pole Position II and Fuji Speedway (complete with a virtually photorealistic Mount Fuji in the background).\\r\\n\\r\\nVersus mode is for two human players only and the record options allows the players to look at his or her previous records. In a race, there are up to fifteen opponents to race against. The player gets rewarded with an opportunity to upgrade his or her equipment after a top five finish on any race course. Bonus equipment includes a faster engine, better tires, and a special dose of nitrous oxide created specifically for Gran Turismo vehicles. All of the bonus automobile parts are automatically installed in the appropriate parts for supercharging the vehicle. Once all the special parts are earned, the automobile is considered to be fully upgraded.

In order to do so, the Arthur must recover the 12 keys of truth from Morgana's lieutenants each of which can only by touched by a specific knight. However in order to be able to defeat them, Arthur must first recover Excalibur and overcome other tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Arthur & the Knights of Justice is a top-down action game. It might be mistaken for an RPG, however the abilities of characters do not change over the course of the game. Players control Arthur King and can recruit two additional party members from the knights. Each knight has his own statistics in various areas including: Life Force, Defense, Strength and Speed. These party members are computer controlled with their own energy bars. Arthur can move up, down, left and right, block with his shield and parry with his shield. Arthur can swing his sword at any time but the damage inflicted depends on how much strength bar he has. The strength bar replenishes itself naturally over time, but is depleted every time Arthur swings his sword. Each knight including Arthur has a health bar, when this bar runs out, the knight is defeated. It can be restored by returning to Camelot or using items such as healing herbs. Arthur can carry a variety of different items accessible from the menu. Other menu functions include looking at the map, changing preferences and reviewing the statistics of the knights.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Role-Playing\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Enix\",\"Developer\":\"Enix\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/3204-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"2100\",\"height\":\"1542\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/3204-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/3204-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"2100\",\"height\":\"1551\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/3204-1.jpg\"}}]}}","King Arthur's World":"{\"id\":\"3826\",\"GameTitle\":\"King Arthur's World\",\"PlatformId\":\"6\",\"Platform\":\"Super Nintendo (SNES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"03/01/1993\",\"Overview\":\"This is a 2D side scrolling strategy game.

The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world.

Among the innovations in Madden 96, the Create-a-Player feature was added, which included many position specific mini-games that would determine the ability of the player. The game also was the first in the Madden series to include secret \\\"classic\\\" teams, which were unlocked by playing any of the 28 pre-expansion NFL franchises in the playoffs and by winning Super Bowl XXX with that team (a rather easy feat as the playoff tournament system allows a player to abort the game while in the lead and still win). The 28 pre-expansion teams were each represented by a classic era equivalent, which ranged from 1960 (Philadelphia Eagles) to 1986 (New York Giants), although all players identified as number-only. Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers, having debuted in 1995, did not have a secret classic team revealed in this manner, nor did the All-Madden team. However, Carolina was attached to the blank slate NFLPA team used for Create-a-Player, and Jacksonville and All-Madden hid the \\\"superteams\\\" with players named after the developers; these teams were accessed using unstated cheat codes.\",\"ESRB\":\"E - Everyone\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Sports\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"EA Sports\",\"Developer\":\"Tiburon Entertainment\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"4\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"25131\",\"PlatformId\":\"20\"},{\"id\":\"4490\",\"PlatformId\":\"18\"},{\"id\":\"28033\",\"PlatformId\":\"36\"},{\"id\":\"11160\",\"PlatformId\":\"10\"}]},\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/290-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/290-1.jpg\"},\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/290-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"1000\",\"height\":\"705\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/290-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/290-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"1000\",\"height\":\"704\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/290-1.jpg\"}}]}}","Madden NFL '97":"{\"id\":\"291\",\"GameTitle\":\"Madden NFL 97\",\"PlatformId\":\"6\",\"Platform\":\"Super Nintendo (SNES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"10/01/1996\",\"Overview\":\"Welcome to Madden NFL 97, the game that captures the excitement of a 30 yard touchdown pass, the strategy of a well executed scoring drive, and the atmosphere of a crisp autumn afternoon in the stadium.

Bubbles can be picked up and dropped by the player's \\\"clown\\\" at the bottom, and are destroyed when three or more of the same color are put together on a single column. \\\"Chains\\\" are formed either when a single drop caused a chain reaction, or when more than one group of bubbles is destroyed in quick succession. The game is normally played with two players (one may be a computer opponent), and chains cause the opponent's stack to descend faster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 24 characters, all but the Black Pierrot being named after a tarot card (although the Strength card has been represented by two characters throughout the series). Different characters have different attack patterns. The columns of the opponent's stack will descend at different rates relative to each other depending on the character chosen. This causes a disjunction of colors that may make it more difficult for the other player to clear their stack.

Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn.

Its making involved a number of Japanese luminaries, including writer Shigesato Itoi, musician/songwriter Keiichi Suzuki, sound designer Hirokazu Tanaka, and future Nintendo president Satoru Iwata. Themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of Americana and Western culture, it subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a real world setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre. Itoi, who directed the game, wanted it to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone. It was heavily marketed upon release via a promotional campaign which sardonically proclaimed \\\"this game stinks\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nInitial reviewers had little praise for Mother 2/EarthBound in the United States, where it sold half as many copies as in Japan. Critics credit this to a combination of the game's simple graphics, the satirical marketing campaign, and a lack of market interest in the genre.

The game seemed to feature an interesting rotating boxing ring. There are no sounds in the game, aside from an announcer at the title screen. The gameplay is not very polished, and computer opponent usually beats you within seconds.

These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. \\r\\n\\r\\nNobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender).

A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre. Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps. The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts. Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the \\\"gold\\\" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Sports\"},\"Players\":\"2\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"U.S. Gold\",\"Developer\":\"Black Pearl\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"4\",\"Game\":[{\"id\":\"10133\",\"PlatformId\":\"25\"},{\"id\":\"21687\",\"PlatformId\":\"4\"},{\"id\":\"4538\",\"PlatformId\":\"18\"},{\"id\":\"28055\",\"PlatformId\":\"36\"}]},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/5719-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"475\",\"height\":\"347\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/5719-1.jpg\"}}}}","On the Ball":"{\"id\":\"5720\",\"GameTitle\":\"On the Ball\",\"PlatformId\":\"6\",\"Platform\":\"Super Nintendo (SNES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/01/1993\",\"Overview\":\"There's a kind of knick-knack you may find in dusty games rooms, a maze through which you navigate a marble by subtly tilting the board, dancing with gravity and momentum, deftly rolling your sphere out of dead ends and around the obstacles posed by holes in the board.

The game might as well have been named \\\"inertia.\\\"  Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing.

It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken.

Apparently, your friend, doggie, likes to eat cookies that has his picture on their box, and he got himself so carried away that he lost the balance, and a bag of cookies fell deep down into an ant-hill. Now, you're goin' in, in a mission of solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for your friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from the one you live in. It's path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates, and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place inside, you'll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend doggie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently. Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you cannot practice that, so if you jusp from a little bit too high position, don't expect much, but to retry the level.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery block, or boulder in a game has a different markings. Like for example, the yellow ones are bricks you can push, and they will just as easily fall, and push, or not, the brick in front of it. The red ones will do the opposite, you cannot push them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits it, it'll continue falling back to the other side. Some bricks explode when you push them, or other brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, 'til they hit some other brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not, the brick in front of them. Anyway, that's the game basics.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach level gives you the new code/password, so you can continue from the position where you ended each time you type that code. Perspective of your ant is like in any other platform game, and you control it with arrow keys, or joystick.

Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art's Racing Destruction Set in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It is a precursor to Rock 'n Roll Racing, which was done by the same developer. Combat, obstacles and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role. There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement, dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro and mines. Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks and armor. There are full race season, single race and custom track modes. In 1 player games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle. In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before. Custom track designing is not intuitive but fairly easy to learn. Players can set the track's laps, gravity and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90° turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. The starting grid can be oriented forward, reversed, face-off with player 1 forward, or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6 slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1), inclined (1:1), or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections is provided to help to orient the section's design to the adjacent sections. If the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s), the player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error immediately.

In order to get vengeance on his peers he performs a ceremony in the gym (most likely referencing the original Megami Tensei) that transports his high school into Makai, the netherworld, where he has somehow become powerful enough to become Majin-Nou (Demon God Emperor). Back at the school, everyone freaks out and is scared except for a select few.The player assumes the role a nameless male or female student, who armed themselves with defensive equipment and COMP. They investigate the realms of Makai which are based on 5 of the 7 deadly sins, and finally face off against Hazama. In their quest, the player will be accompanied by fellow students and demons recruited through either negotiation or from the process of fusion, or via the Jakyou.There are four possible paths in the game, but unlike the previous games, they are not decided by the alignment system. Instead, right in the beginning of the game the player must choose one of the four main characters as a companion to investigate the misterious events and the Makai. Each main character has a defined path and once one has been chosen, the player is locked on that path. Yumi, Reiko and Charlie visit the worlds based off the deadly sins (Yumi and Reiko visit the same worlds, Charlie visits a few different ones), while Akira puts the player in an entirely different setting. Akira's path is much more difficult and, instead of being segmented among worlds, is composed by just one huge tower very similar to Persona 3's Tartarus. This path focuses much more heavily on the 'Dungeon Crawler' aspect of the game.Each of the worlds raise a few philosophical questions about the nature and consequences of the deadly sins, but the game presents these conflicts in a non-theological manner.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Role-Playing\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Atlus\",\"Developer\":\"Atlus\",\"Images\":{\"fanart\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"fanart/original/21146-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"1920\",\"height\":\"1080\"}},\"thumb\":\"fanart/thumb/21146-1.jpg\"},\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/21146-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"538\",\"height\":\"962\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/21146-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/21146-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"526\",\"height\":\"964\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/21146-1.jpg\"}}]}}","Shin Momotarou Densetsu":"{\"id\":\"34644\",\"GameTitle\":\"Shin Momotarou Densetsu\",\"PlatformId\":\"6\",\"Platform\":\"Super Nintendo (SNES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"12/24/1993\",\"Overview\":\"Shin Momotarou Densetsu is a Role-Playing game, published by Hudson, which was released in Japan in 1993.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Role-Playing\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3B6_s8EdSw\",\"Publisher\":\"Hudson Soft\",\"Developer\":\"Hudson Soft\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/34644-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"226\",\"height\":\"400\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/34644-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/34644-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"223\",\"height\":\"400\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/34644-1.jpg\"}}],\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/34644-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"260\",\"height\":\"226\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/34644-1.jpg\"}}}","Shin Naki no Ryuu - Mahjong Hishouden":{},"Shin Nekketsu Kouha - Kunio-tachi no Banka":"{\"id\":\"23216\",\"GameTitle\":\"Shin Nekketsu Kouha: Kunio-tachi no Banka\",\"AlternateTitles\":{\"title\":\"新・熱血硬派 くにおたちの挽歌\"},\"PlatformId\":\"6\",\"Platform\":\"Super Nintendo (SNES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/01/1994\",\"Overview\":\"Kunio and Riki are convicted of a hit and run accident and the two are sentenced to be locked away in the West Nerima Juvenile Correction Facility.

Designer Toshio Iwai was inspired by his earlier interactive installation art piece titled Music Insects, to develop a video game at Nintendo between 1993 and late 1994. The completed product was inexplicably canceled by Nintendo, and the game's key elements were later developed into Maxis's 1996 PC game release titled SimTunes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSound Fantasy contains eccentric concepts and untested game mechanics. Music games, especially on home consoles, were not popular in the early 1990s, and it wouldn't be until much later in the decade that they gained mainstream attention.[citation needed] The Sound Fantasy prototype contains four different games in one cartridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nPix Quartet was inspired by Toshio Iwai's Music Insects. There are four insects of different colors, where the player can select different insect to each represent a different instrument. They crawl all over the screen, where the player can draw. Insects that crawl over a colored pixel make a note. Each color represents a different note for each insects. Sample Demos can be loaded to demonstrate the capabilities of this game.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeat Hopper contains three different modes: A-type, B-type and Training. A-type is a rhythm game in the style of Q-bert, where an insect on a pogo must make every block disappear after stepping on it as many times needed. Each block makes its own sound and the order does not matter. The player can improvise a song with each block. B-type requires the player to follow a path of blocks that appears every time the player touches one. The player must make as many steps as possible without losing three lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nIce Sweeper indicates two modes: A-type and B-type.

Each player's character is armed with a gun, which shoots a vertical cable. If this hits a bubble, it will cause it to split in two.

The largest bubbles will have 4 degrees of splitting before clearing. Many level layouts have ladders, barriers and breakable bricks in part of the screen, affecting movement of both the player and the bubbles. Faster bubbles in the shape of diamonds also bounce around the screen going any which way rather than bouncing in predictable arcs like the other bubbles.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral power-up tokens are also available, offering features such as splitting all bubbles down to their minimal size, freezing the bubbles for a few seconds, and various different weapons. Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can often be directed by the cable weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the main Tour mode, the game also features Panic mode, in which a succession of bubbles are thrown at at the players.

Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.

This character just keeps walking around and gets scared at the silliest things. While he aimlessly wanders around the playfield, Tetris like pieces fall from the top of the screen, and the player must rotate and position them in the scene. Once in place, these blocks can be used by Gussun to climb on to reach new areas, and eventually lead him through the exit door. Tons of other features are also packed with the game, such as bombs or little buddies who follow Gussun to the exit (collect 10 of them for an extra life!). Time is of course limited and water starts filling up the stage if players stay in one levels for too long.

It was succeeded by Super Nazo Puyo Tsu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjouki. A Nuisance Puyo variation known as Iron Puyo was introduced in this game.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuper Nazo Puyo: Rulue no Roux uses the basic rules of Puyo Puyo. The game controls like a normal Puyo Puyo game with all five colors available and the ability to roate clockwise and counter clockwise, except the ability to double rotate and climb is not possible. Each puzzle gives the player different objectives to clear. The objectives range from clearing all of a specific color of Puyo, clearing all Nuisance Puyo, creating a specific chain length, clearing a certain amount of Puyo simultaneously, or simply clear the whole board. Every time the player fails to complete a puzzle, the player's health will deplete, as indicated by Arle or Rulue's expression gradually getting more distressed. If the player's health depletes completely, they'll receive a Game Over and can either choose to continue from the last save or quit back to the title. The player can recover completely if the gauges on the right side of the screen fills completely and rank up, with each cleared puzzle filling it gradually. On the pause menu, the player has the option to skip a puzzle at the cost of health.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are five game modes: Arle's Roux, Rulue's Roux, Road to Chains, Endless Puyo, and Editor. In the first three modes, the player must solve the presented tasks with a set of available Puyo. Arle's Roux focuses on a scenario with Arle, acting as the normal course with her puzzles only involving standard Puyo. Rulue's Roux is the mode that focuses on Rulue and acts as the expert mode, with her puzzles including Iron Puyo and Blocks. In both modes, the objective is to clear puzzle sets from varies characters within an area, with one character acting as a boss that cannot be challenged until the others are beaten. Once the boss of a given area is beaten, the player will progress to the next area. Road to Chains acts as a challenge mode where the player is given a series of puzzles to solve at a gradually increasing difficulty, with the player being unable to restore health.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Endless Puyo mode is a regular endless mode except that 6 next Puyo are shown instead of 1 next Puyo, and that nuisance Puyo will fall in the higher levels of difficulty. The Editor mode allows you to place Puyo freely in a manner similar to Practice Notebook in Puyo Puyo 7.

However, despite what the title may suggest, contained within are actually four different versions of Tetris: Tetris Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line \\\"standard\\\" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.\\r\\n\\r\\nTetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":[\"Action\",\"Puzzle\"]},\"Players\":\"4+\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Blue Planet Software\",\"Developer\":\"TOSE\",\"Rating\":\"9.5\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/25772-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"351\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/25772-1.jpg\"}}}}","Super Troll Islands":"{\"id\":\"6176\",\"GameTitle\":\"Super Troll Islands\",\"PlatformId\":\"6\",\"Platform\":\"Super Nintendo (SNES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/01/1993\",\"Overview\":\"Arcade platform game, based on the license of those bright-haired cute naked chaps.

After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer.

The game is divided in a world-map screen, a top-down \\\"town\\\" mode and a turn-based fight mode in which the characters are taken to generic tiled top-down arenas in which they select each character and move or attack depending on their action points.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnemies can be seen on the map instead of jumping at you at random intervals, and you can freely decide whether to engage them or simply circle them around. The game uses a combination of hand-drawn sprites and CGI pre-rendered one (mostly for the main characters) with a distinct cute or Super Deformed design (as usual for most console RPGs).\",\"ESRB\":\"E10+ - Everyone 10+\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Role-Playing\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Square\",\"Developer\":\"Sting\",\"Rating\":\"7\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/6309-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"2100\",\"height\":\"1374\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/6309-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/6309-2.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"2100\",\"height\":\"1382\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/6309-2.jpg\"}}]}}","Trendline - Flashing Intro (PD)":{},"Tri-Star Super 8 BIOS":{},"Trinea":{},"Troddlers":"{\"id\":\"6310\",\"GameTitle\":\"Troddlers\",\"PlatformId\":\"6\",\"Platform\":\"Super Nintendo (SNES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/01/1993\",\"Overview\":\"Troddlers is a puzzle game in the vein of Lemmings.

His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.\\r\\n\\r\\nCatalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada.

Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight.

Hindering your goal are random events such as solar eclipses (which can render your solar panels inactive) and also a different, hostile alien race that inhabits the planets in the many scenarios at offer. \\r\\n\\r\\nNot only do you have to be a good mayor but you also have to be a good general. Resources must not only be attributed to civilian research but into weapons research, intelligence and the building of tanks and spaceships, if you wish to survive long enough to see your colony flourish into a metropolis. As a rule, you will have built a strong colony before the aliens come, but the final push towards a QOL of 80% or higher can only be achieved once there is no outside threat.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Life Simulation\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Konami\",\"Developer\":\"Gremlin\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/6325-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"391\",\"height\":\"266\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/6325-1.jpg\"}}}}","VS.

They can also send the bat forward a short distance, which helps to collect items, defeat enemies and hit the ball.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game was released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom in 1994.\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":[\"Action\",\"Puzzle\"]},\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lba0qwvUQ3g\",\"Publisher\":\"Den'Z\",\"Developer\":\"Opera House\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":[{\"_\":\"boxart/original/back/37772-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"back\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"1119\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/back/37772-1.jpg\"}},{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/37772-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"640\",\"height\":\"1149\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/37772-1.jpg\"}}],\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/37772-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"260\",\"height\":\"226\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/37772-1.jpg\"}}}","Zombies Ate My Neighbors":"{\"id\":\"1361\",\"GameTitle\":\"Zombies Ate My Neighbors\",\"AlternateTitles\":{\"title\":\"Zombies\"},\"PlatformId\":\"6\",\"Platform\":\"Super Nintendo (SNES)\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"09/01/1993\",\"Overview\":\"In the game you are a male or female protagonist (Zeke or Julia), fighting the vampires, mummies, zombies, etc. on over 50 levels (not including secrets) and saving all of the people you find.
