There are two types of transport that the player's company can take: passengers or building materials. The former is more likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow. Wherever the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct buildings for the city. These start with houses, but eventually, as an area grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow can be seen as a goal in itself. As well as the buildings built by the computer, in response to the materials being present, the player can construct their own buildings, such as ski resorts and hotels, and make profits from them if the conditions are right.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Construction and Management Simulation"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Pack-In-Video","Developer":"Artdink","Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/33784-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/33784-1.jpg"},"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/33784-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"300","height":"552","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/33784-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/33784-1.jpg","$":{"width":"512","height":"447"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/33784-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/33784-2.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/33784-2.jpg"}]}},"AK LIVE Hit Gang":{},"ASCII Data 1":{},"ASCII Data 2":{},"ASCII Data 3":{},"ASCII Music Tool (1995.11.02 v1.0)":{},"ASDF":{},"AYT BBS Intro (PD)":{},"AYT BBTR (PD)":{},"AYT Demo (PD)":{},"Accele Brid":{},"Ace wo Nerae!":{},"Acrobat Mission":{"id":"18940","GameTitle":"Acrobat Mission","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"11/09/1992","Overview":"Acrobat Mission is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game released by UPL in 1991, licensed to Taito for manufacture and distribution. It was ported to Nintendo Super Famicom in 1992.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2100, the Earth's environment is devastated by its inhabitants, who develop their space technology to live on Mars. Before they left, the humans created a Bio-Computer assigned to replenish Earth's ecosystem in hopes of returning to Earth. 50 years after terra-forming parts of Mars, the human colonists were attacked by mysterious, but hostile UFOs. The military leaders among the colonists set up an attack force to defend the colonists using state of the art fighter ships identified as the Icarus. The main operation of attack is called \"Acrobat Mission\" because it exceeds the technical flying ability of the pilots.\r\nIn the arcade version, surviving fighter pilots Jet and Nova are available for the player to choose for the rest of the game, but both were discluded from the Super Famicom port, making the player's pilot anonymous as well as discarding Nova's custom color scheme.\r\nHere however is the story, exactly as it appears at the beginning of the game, with spelling and grammar mistakes preserved:\r\n\"AD 2100: HUMANS EXTERMINATED BY THEIR OWN NATURE DISTRUPTION AND ESCAPE TO MARS LEAVING BIO-COMPUTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RECUPERATION OF EARTH. ONE DAY HALF A CENTURY AFTER HUMANS ARRIVED, MARS WAS ATTACKED BY STRANGE FLYING OBJECTES. TO FIGHT THESE ENEMIES, THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE DEFENCE AGENCY ORGANIZED THE TASK FORCE ARMY AND STARTED THE DOG FIGHT WITH INVADERS QUICLY. THE OPERATION WAS CALLED \"ACROBAT MISSION\" AS IT EXCEEDED THE PILOT'S TECHNICAL LIMIT.\"\r\n\r\nPlayers started the game equipped with the default weapon, the Standard Shot: a semi-automatic laser weapon. Though moderately powerful, the Standard Shot cannot be upgraded or charged. Once the player has lost a significant number of lives and their selected weapon his lost its upgrades, the Standard Shot will once again take over.\r\nTwo other weapons are selectable to the player, one of which is the Wave Shot (announced as Wide in the Arcade version). The Wave Shot is a spread shot that increases in size, numbers and strength. When charged, the Wave Shot can unleash a short range, but powerful laser blast that increases in width and strength when Wave icons are collected. The other weapon was the Hurricane Shot, a unique area-effect weapon that encircles the ship clockwise when fired before flying forward. When charged, the Hurricane Shot fires a ball of energy across the screen, but there is a one second delay every time the shot is fired.\r\nThe player also had Bombs although unlike many shooters, the player can only hold up to two bombs. Once collected however, the two bombs get physically mounted under the ship's wings. If an enemy shot hits one of the bombs, then the bomb will detonate, creating a destructive shield for the player. The player can manually detonate either bomb at will.\r\nThe player's Icarus fighter ship has a number of defenses at its disposal as well. Whenever the player moves their ship in any given direction, a burst of flame from the ship's jet exhaust will shoot out from the opposite direction the player moves the ship in. This applies to all directions: left, right, front, back and all four diagonal angles. This jet exhaust not only serves an aesthetic purpose, but it can also harm nearby enemies and destroy nearby objects.\r\nWhenever the player is hit, their ship will steer wildly out of control. Once this happens, a timer will appear near the ship which indicates how long the ship has until it explodes. The explosion of the player's ship will harm any nearby enemies. Also, because the Icarus is apparently well built, any kamikaze enemies or drifting objects that touch it will not damage or destroy the player's ship, allowing the player less restrictive movement.","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":{"genre":"Shooter"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Techiku","Developer":"Micronics","Rating":"2","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"32652","PlatformId":"23"}},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/18940-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/18940-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/18940-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1441","height":"795","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/18940-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/18940-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"387","height":"214","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/18940-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/18940-1.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/18940-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/18940-2.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/18940-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/18940-3.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"223"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/18940-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/18940-4.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"223"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/18940-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/18940-5.jpg","$":{"width":"260","height":"226"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/18940-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/18940-6.jpg","$":{"width":"2120","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/18940-6.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/18940-7.jpg","$":{"width":"738","height":"416"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/18940-7.jpg"}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/18940.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"150"}}}},"ActRaiser":{"id":"1046","GameTitle":"ActRaiser","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"11/01/1991","Overview":"ACTION & SIMULATION GAME\r\nThis sensational game combines pulse-stopping action sequences with an intelligent Simulation Mode, allowing the player to forge a new civilization.

You'll face such hellish creatures as vultures, gargoyles, bats, ghosts and ghouls.\r\n\r\nDuring your mission, you'll run into Gomez, Morticia, Lurch and other members of the Addams Family, who are on the grounds to lend advice and provide items. These items include a box of seeds for producing enemy-attacking mini bushes, black beetle cookies which give Fester a dose of ill-health (this is a good thing), stone marbles for turning attackers into rock, a bowling ball for hitting enemies and breaking through walls and a battery, which powers up Fester's standard Zzap attack. Within the seven levels of play, there are tons of other creatures to zap and items to find.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Role-Playing"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuFvurCnrHQ","Publisher":"Ocean Software","Developer":"Ocean Software","Rating":"4.5","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"9414","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"35430","PlatformId":"36"}]},"Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1531-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1531-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1531-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1531-2.jpg"}],"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1531-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"2100","height":"1542","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1531-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1531-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"2100","height":"1551","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1531-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1531-1.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1531-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1531-2.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1531-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1531-3.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1531-3.jpg"}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/1531.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"121"}}}},"Addams Family, The":{"id":"3668","GameTitle":"The Addams Family","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"03/01/1992","Overview":"Creepy, Kooky, Ooky, Spooky.\r\n\r\nTHE ADDAMS FAMILY has been evicted!

Story mode comes in interactive mode (with passwords) or as a short movie that can be watched in less than an hour. Although the game is directed towards children, literacy in both Japanese and English is required in order to properly enjoy the story mode and to fully understand the rules. The three arcade games present in the game include painting the roses red, whacking characters from the story, matching creatures like in the card game Concentration. The painting mode can be likened to an extremely simplified version of Mario Paint.\r\n\r\nThere is only one eraser tool and paintings cannot be saved into memory or printed on a printer. Only 16 colors can be used on canvases that feature the film's characters; the full 256-color spectrum is reserved for the blank canvas. While the blank canvas allows for total creativity for older children, the \"character canvases\" are good for teaching hand-to-eye coordination with very young children. During the interactive adventure, the Queen of Hearts divides a magic globe into three different colored miniature globes. As a result, all the color in Wonderland turns into monochrome and Alice must find the globes in order to restore color to Wonderland.\r\n\r\nAdditional content was unlocked by scanning barcodes with Barcode Battler II connected via a \"Barcode Battler II Interface\".\r\n\r\nThe Super NES Mouse is also supported as a method to play the game.","ESRB":"EC - Early Childhood","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Epoch","Developer":"SAS Sakata","Rating":"1","Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/33785-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/33785-1.jpg"},"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/33785-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"430","height":"800","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/33785-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/33785-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"480"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/33785-1.jpg"}}},"Alien 3":{"id":"2970","GameTitle":"Alien 3","AlternateTitles":{"title":["Alien³","Alien III","Alien3"]},"PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1993","Overview":"Alien³ is video game based on the movie sequel of the same name.

The game was originally targeted to pre-teen and younger teenage girls, but became unexpectedly popular with older teenagers and women in their 20s. Angelique is credited with \"set[ing] up the speciﬁcs and conventions of women’s games: a focus on romance, easy controls and utilizing other multimedia.\" In 2002, Konami released its very successful Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side, which brought many new fans to the still-new genre. In 2006, Famitsu's listings for the Top 20 selling love games included seven otome games. Early games borrowed heavily from the iconography and story conventions of \"retro shoujo manga\", \"the archetypical girly heroines, the emphasis on pure, sexless, tranquil romance and on a peaceful, stable setting\", but as the category expanded, other narrative and gameplay elements were introduced, including action/adventure, combat and plots in which \"the heroine can ‘save the world’ and ‘get the guy’ at the same time\".\r\n\r\nCommercially available English-developed otome games in modern times include Date Warp, Fatal Hearts, and Heileen. The latter two also include options for lesbian romance. McKenzie & Co(1995) from American Laser Games and Girl's Club (1992) from Philips Interactive were simulation games for girls developed and released in the US in the past.\r\n\r\nHakuouki: Shinsengumi Kitan was announced for a North American release on February 14, 2012 by Aksys.

But, like in most pretty pictures, perfection is an illusion, and Olympus' peaceful facade hides a dark secret, a violent struggle between human and cyborg that could once again plunge the world into war... and genocide.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=https://AkhGEQ36z-I","Publisher":"Visit","Developer":"Kan's","Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/17195-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/17195-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/17195-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"208","height":"378","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/17195-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/17195-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"591","height":"1080","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/17195-1.png"}}],"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/17195-1.jpg","$":{"width":"312","height":"226"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/17195-1.jpg"}}},"Arabian Nights - Sabaku no Seirei Ou":{"id":"14812","GameTitle":"Arabian Nights: Sabaku no Seirei-ou","AlternateTitles":{"title":"Arabian Nights: Desert Spirit King"},"PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"06/14/1996","Overview":"In this Japan-exclusive Super Famicom game, the player assumes the role of an orphan named Shukran, who is accompanied by the djinn Ifrit on her adventures to bring peace to her desert homeland.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Takara","Developer":"Pandora Box","Rating":"10","Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/14812-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/14812-1.jpg"},"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/14812-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"413","height":"750","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/14812-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/14812-1.jpg","$":{"width":"540","height":"485"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/14812-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/14812-2.jpg","$":{"width":"540","height":"490"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/14812-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/14812-3.jpg","$":{"width":"540","height":"486"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/14812-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/14812-4.jpg","$":{"width":"540","height":"481"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/14812-4.jpg"}]}},"Araiguma Rascal":{},"Arcade's Greatest Hits":{},"Arcade's Greatest Hits - The Atari Collection 1":{"id":"1568","GameTitle":"Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 1","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"08/30/1997","Overview":"Another in the series of Midway's retro arcade compilations, this is the first to feature early Atari titles (in addition to the usual FMV interview segments.)\r\n\r\nThe games included are:\r\n\r\nAsteroids (vector space shooter)\r\nBattlezone (vector 3D tank shooter)\r\nCentipede (insect shooter)\r\nMissile Command (missile shooter)\r\nSuper Breakout (the more varied sequel to Breakout, and the only non-shooter in this collection)\r\nTempest (color vector shooter)","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Midway","Developer":"Digital Eclipse","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"12188","PlatformId":"10"}},"Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1568-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1568-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/1568-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/1568-2.jpg"}],"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/1568-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"703","height":"484","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/1568-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/1568-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"442","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1568-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/1568-1.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/1568-1.jpg"},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/1568.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"62"}}}},"Arcadia Intro 1 (PD)":{},"Arcadia Intro 2 (PD)":{},"Arcadia Ms. Pac-Man Intro (PD)":{},"Arcana":{"id":"1707","GameTitle":"Arcana","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"03/27/1992","Overview":"In this game you play as a young boy named Rooks.

Characters have HP, MP (SP for fighter characters), EXP, equipment, stats and class-specific, SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs. The player can explore his surroundings, talk to people and visit shops when not in battle, though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to leave the current area.\r\n\r\nThe game's core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties, which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating turns so that each party can move once and/or attack once a turn. Attacks are divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former, a party uses a special ability (e.g. casting fireballs, throwing lightning, healing allies) of one of its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same ability, they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat results in less money and generally less damage, but the target cannot retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice, etc. Close-up, each unit in two adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES combat, they can attack an enemy, use an item or a special ability (though these can't be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend.\r\n\r\nDragons are the player's ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain experience like normal characters do. In battle, each party has a dragon attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its dragon: if a party's dragon is slain, the party will lose the ability to use special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map.

The operation was driven by Adolf Hitler's ideological desire to conquer the Soviet territories as outlined in his 1925 manifesto Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\").\r\nIn the two years leading up to the invasion, the two countries signed political and economic pacts for strategic purposes. Still, on 18 December 1940, Hitler authorized an invasion of the Soviet Union for a start date of 15 May 1941, but this was not met; instead, the invasion began on 22 June 1941. Over the course of the operation, about four million soldiers of the Axis powers invaded the Soviet Union along a 2,900-kilometer (1,800 mi) front, the largest invasion force in the history of warfare. In addition to troops, the Germans employed some 600,000 motor vehicles and between 600–700,000 horses.

He also has a special roar that allows him to stun certain enemies. This becomes necessary in some sections in order to freeze bats so the Beast can use them as stepping stones to higher platforms. The game has a time limit in the form of the magical rose. The Beast must battle through such levels as the dungeon and the main hall battling giant spiders, rats, rogue candle monsters, live gargoyle statues, and enchanted brooms, while collecting books for points (since Belle likes books) and magic mirrors that allow the Beast to see further into the current level to anticipate what challenges await.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":["Adventure","Platform"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","Developer":"Probe Entertainment Limited","Rating":"5","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"22981","PlatformId":"4917"}},"Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/3170-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/3170-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/3170-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/3170-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/3170-3.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/3170-3.jpg"}],"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/3170-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"500","height":"342","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/3170-1.jpg"}}}},"Beavis and Butt-head":{"id":"3860","GameTitle":"Beavis and Butt-head","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"07/01/1994","Overview":"Based on the successful cartoon 'Beavis and Butt-head', the game is very faithful to the series.\r\n\r\nIt game stars at the home of Beavis and Butt-head - and from there you can choose to go to different locations like: Turbo mall 2000, the street, burger world, hospital, GWAR concert and more... your main goal is to find money to the GWAR concert.","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Viacom New Media","Developer":"Realtime Associates","Rating":"3","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"18302","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"24272","PlatformId":"20"},{"id":"4285","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"20257","PlatformId":"36"}]},"Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/3860-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/3860-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/3860-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/3860-2.jpg"}],"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/3860-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"2100","height":"1512","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/3860-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/3860-2.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"2100","height":"1536","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/3860-2.jpg"}}],"banner":{"_":"graphical/3860-g.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/3860.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"149"}}}},"Bebe's Kids":{"id":"1713","GameTitle":"Bebe's Kids","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"04/01/1994","Overview":"Bébé's Kids is an action-oriented Super NES video game that is loosely based on the movie of the same name.

As the fighters receive punishment, these portraits show injuries such as cuts and bruises, the severity of which indicate the fighter's health (or lack of). There is also a boxing glove shaped meter at the top of the screen, that indicates how much power a boxer has left in his punches (as in a real fight, the more punches boxers throw, the more tired they become, resulting in weaker punches).\r\n \r\nThe fighters movement about the ring is limited to side-stepping left or right; it is impossible to step back or forward. A variety of punches can be thrown; left jabs, crosses to the head, hooks to the body, and uppercuts to the head (all punches except jabs can be thrown with either hand). It is also possible to throw a limited number of so-called 'super punches', that are essentially either a right cross or a right uppercut, but with extra power. At the start of each round, each boxer is capable of throwing one super-punch at any time, although it becomes possible to throw one more with each knockdown they score against their opponent. Defensive techniques consist of blocking, dodging, and clinching. Each boxer has three attributes: 'power', 'stamina', and 'chin'.","Genres":{"genre":["Fighting","Sports"]},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Electro Brain","Developer":"Sculptured Software","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"4293","PlatformId":"18"}},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/17856-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/17856-1.jpg"},"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/17856-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"475","height":"347","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/17856-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/17856.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"184"}}}},"Brain Lord":{"id":"1718","GameTitle":"Brain Lord","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"01/29/1994","Overview":"In \"Brain Lord\", you play a young traveler and warrior who is searching for his long lost father.

The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant \"Module\" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed \"Berserkers\". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.\r\n\r\nCyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind \"NeoParts\", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.\r\n\r\nCombat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of \"options\" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Publisher":"Tonkinhouse","Developer":"Advance Communication Company","Rating":"5.5","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"23256","PlatformId":"34"}},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/3545-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"298","height":"535","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/3545-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/3545-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"298","height":"534","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/3545-1.jpg"}}]}},"Cyber Knight II - Chikyuu Teikoku no Yabou":{"id":"20006","GameTitle":"Cyber Knight II: Chikyuu Teikoku no Yabou","AlternateTitles":{"title":["Cyber Knight II","Cyber Knight 2"]},"PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"08/26/1994","Overview":"Cyber Knight 2 is a direct story sequel to the original (whose translation was also done by Aeon Genesis.)

It is a time of civil war amongst the federated planets, and the crew has been thrown directly into the center! Soon, new weapons called Metalliforms are created, which the General intends to use to conquer the galaxy!\r\n\r\nThis thing´s moved really fast. It took just under two months, but it´s at the point where the game is not only fully playable, but it´s also one of the nicest pieces of work I´ve done yet.

You name it, this thing´s got all the bells and whistles.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is fantastic, too. It´s got everything about the original Cyber Knight that was refreshing and nifty, cleans up the spotty bits that were a little aggravating, and improves on the forumla ten times over. This game is seriously amazing, folks. I haven´t had this much fun playtesting a game since Shin Megami Tensei. Even if you didn´t like the original Cyber Knight, chances are you´ll love this one. The story´s better, there´s an autobattle, there are even more neoparts, the star map interface is greatly improved, your \"inactive\" characters are automatically relegated to Support Modules and are able to not only gain combat experience but also use their skills and sometimes even finish battles before they even begin...

The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda...\r\n\r\nThe game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as both the \"good\" hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called \"Soul Power\", while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5uQFviNoIc","Publisher":"Enix Corporation","Developer":"Westone Co., Ltd.","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/3548-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"400","height":"224","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/3548-1.jpg"}}}},"Dark Kingdom":{"id":"33428","GameTitle":"Dark Kingdom","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"04/29/1994","Overview":"The object is to play an evil mercenary named Gene Dorman.

The game centers on Timmy and his friend Jamie, two young children who are accidentally transported to a world resembling prehistoric Earth populated by anthropomorphic dinosaurs. While a device which will allow them to return home exists in this environment, a critical component has been stolen by Mr. Big, leader of a gang of Neanderthals known as The Rockeys, leaving the player to guide Timmy or Jamie to his castle to retrieve it.

This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends.\r\n\r\nThere are four different icons that have different effects when combined:\r\nBooks, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords.\r\nBottles heal a certain amount of health.\r\nPurple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.\r\n\r\nChain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.\r\n\r\nMore complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons.

The player commands a party of varying size and characters with diverse skills.\r\n\r\nIn the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.\r\n\r\nEach party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.\r\n\r\nThe map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.\r\n\r\nIn some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":{"genre":["Role-Playing","Strategy"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Yanoman","Developer":"Max Entertainment","Rating":"7","Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/3606-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/3606-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/3606-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/3606-2.jpg"}],"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/3606-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"540","height":"982","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/3606-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/3606-2.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"540","height":"979","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/3606-2.jpg"}}]}},"Fenek - 6 Gatsugou":{},"Few 256 Color Pics, A (PD)":{},"Fighter's History":{"id":"1912","GameTitle":"Fighter's History","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"05/27/1994","Overview":"There are three different gameplay modes are available.

The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...\r\n\r\nGun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Adventure","Shooter"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Square","Developer":"Square","Rating":"6","Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/3624-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/3624-1.jpg"},"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/3624-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"347","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/3624-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/3624-1.jpg","$":{"width":"243","height":"218"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/3624-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/3624-2.jpg","$":{"width":"242","height":"213"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/3624-2.jpg"}]}},"Full Throttle Racing":{"id":"3625","GameTitle":"Full Throttle Racing","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1994","Overview":"Full Throttle Racing takes in chaotic, violent and no-holds-barred racing across America.

The game is based on the 1996 Super GT racing season using the horsepower standards and rules of the era.  \r\n\r\nDuring championship mode, the player is asked enter a number, his or her driver's name, and the team name that he or she will use during the championship. The driver's name and team can be entered using either English or Japanese letters. When a player beats a record, he or she is asked to insert his or her number, name or initials (up to four characters and two digits for the number). Championship mode can last for multiple seasons. Playing ninety-nine seasons in a single racing career is theoretically possible due to the double-digit nature of the season information. There are eight different tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit that has been shown in video games since Pole Position II and Fuji Speedway (complete with a virtually photorealistic Mount Fuji in the background).\r\n\r\nVersus mode is for two human players only and the record options allows the players to look at his or her previous records. In a race, there are up to fifteen opponents to race against. The player gets rewarded with an opportunity to upgrade his or her equipment after a top five finish on any race course. Bonus equipment includes a faster engine, better tires, and a special dose of nitrous oxide created specifically for Gran Turismo vehicles. All of the bonus automobile parts are automatically installed in the appropriate parts for supercharging the vehicle. Once all the special parts are earned, the automobile is considered to be fully upgraded. The ultimate goal is to win the Gran Turismo championship for his or her team in addition for him/herself.\r\n\r\nThe \"free practice\" is essentially a time trial mode where the player races by him/herself for up to ten laps. Acquiring damage is still possible either crashing into walls or through normal wear and tear. The fastest lap time gets captured for the record book just like in the other modes of the game.

When you're the size of an insect everything looks humongous, but even normal-sized people will agree that Harley's adventure is humongous.","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Adventure"]},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Hi-Tech Expressions","Developer":"Visual Concepts","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/1920-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1023","height":"730","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/1920-1.jpg"}}}},"Harukanaru Augusta":{},"Harukanaru Augusta 2 - Masters":{},"Harukanaru Augusta 3 - Masters New":{},"Harvest Moon":{"id":"1921","GameTitle":"Harvest Moon","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"08/09/1996","Overview":"Ever wanted to live life on a farm, with nothing but the sun, the fresh scent of your crops, the muddy fields underneath, and cows and chickens to keep you company?

A North American release Super Soccer Champ 2 was scheduled, however it was canceled.\r\n\r\nThe game permits players to play soccer on an international level with all the national teams that took part in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, except the inclusion of Japan instead of South Korea.\r\n\r\nMost of the text is in Japanese; including the players' surnames. Eight different players can become the captain of the player's team and the team can use one of five different formations (4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero). All of the formations are used in modern day soccer except for the WM formation (which saw common use in England during the 1930s). The star player (captain) chosen kicks a shot (super shot or hyper shot) that pushes the goalkeeper into the stands, just like in Hat Trick Hero. Exhibition, world league (similar to a World Cup tournament) and Taito Cup (24 teams to beat) are the three possible variations in the game. After beating all the 23 national teams in the Taito cup mode, there is a final game against a team with the abbreviation \"NLC\". Mode 7 graphics give the game a sense of perspective.\r\n\r\nHat Trick Hero 2 is the sequel to Football Champ in Japan (where it was known as Hat Trick Hero), and is loosely based on the coin-operated video game Hat Trick Hero '93.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Taito","Developer":"Neverland Co.","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/26334-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"275","height":"506","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/26334-1.jpg"}}}},"Hatayama Hatch no Pro Yakyuu News!

Unusually for an RPG there is also the option to just talk with the rogue Labor's pilot and try to convince them to back down - as a policeman, sometimes this is the only way forward.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Interbec","Developer":"BEC","Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/34673-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/34673-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/34673-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/34673-2.jpg"}],"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/34673-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"500","height":"885","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/34673-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/34673-1.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/34673-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/34673-2.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/34673-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/34673-3.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/34673-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/34673-4.jpg","$":{"width":"256","height":"224"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/34673-4.jpg"}]}},"Kidou Senshi Gundam - Cross Dimension 0079":{},"Kidou Senshi Gundam F91 - Formula Senki 0122":{"id":"24837","GameTitle":"Kidou Senshi Gundam F91 Formula Senki 0122","AlternateTitles":{"title":"Mobile Suit Gundam F91 Formula Wars 0122"},"PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"07/06/1991","Overview":"In U.C. 0122, the detached corps of the Mars Zeon, led by Charles Rochester, invades Earth with assistance from the Crossbone Vanguard.

Only the Spell of Spells would be able to free them. Merlin, knowing that the world would come to ruin without King Arthur uses his magic to search all of space and time for replacements. Finding the New York Knights football team and their quarterback, Arthur King, Merlin transports them back to Camelot and gives them magical armor. Transformed into; Sir Arthur, Sir Breeze, Sir Brick, Sir Darren, Sir Gallop, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lug, Sir Phil, Sir Tone, Sir Trunk, Sir Wally and Sir Zeke,  they must rescue the real Knights of the Round Table. In order to do so, the Arthur must recover the 12 keys of truth from Morgana's lieutenants each of which can only by touched by a specific knight. However in order to be able to defeat them, Arthur must first recover Excalibur and overcome other tasks.\r\n\r\nKing Arthur & the Knights of Justice is a top-down action game. It might be mistaken for an RPG, however the abilities of characters do not change over the course of the game. Players control Arthur King and can recruit two additional party members from the knights. Each knight has his own statistics in various areas including: Life Force, Defense, Strength and Speed. These party members are computer controlled with their own energy bars. Arthur can move up, down, left and right, block with his shield and parry with his shield. Arthur can swing his sword at any time but the damage inflicted depends on how much strength bar he has. The strength bar replenishes itself naturally over time, but is depleted every time Arthur swings his sword. Each knight including Arthur has a health bar, when this bar runs out, the knight is defeated. It can be restored by returning to Camelot or using items such as healing herbs. Arthur can carry a variety of different items accessible from the menu. Other menu functions include looking at the map, changing preferences and reviewing the statistics of the knights.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Enix","Developer":"Enix","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/3204-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"2100","height":"1542","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/3204-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/3204-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"2100","height":"1551","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/3204-1.jpg"}}]}},"King Arthur's World":{"id":"3826","GameTitle":"King Arthur's World","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"03/01/1993","Overview":"This is a 2D side scrolling strategy game.

The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.\r\n\r\nWhile the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. \r\n\r\nThe twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"THQ","Developer":"Storm Sales","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"24086","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"5047","PlatformId":"21"},{"id":"4671","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"28028","PlatformId":"36"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/3210-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/3210-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/3210-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"2100","height":"1542","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/3210-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/3210-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"2100","height":"1551","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/3210-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/3210.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"63"}}}},"Leading Company":{},"Leading Jockey":{"id":"37799","GameTitle":"Leading Jockey","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"09/16/1994","Overview":"Leading Jockey is a horse racing game for the Super Famicom.

The player is able to attack with their primary weapon and jump. Throwing weapons can also be used, which consume money for each one thrown. Attacking innocent villagers will cause the player to lose money. Money can also be gained (or lost) by visiting one of the numerous mini games, often in houses: which include mazes, whack-a-mole, the lottery, dice, a 3D labyrinth and a game trivia quiz show. Other businesses such as shops, resturants, inns and judo training can also be visited.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each village is an \"action area\" which changes the game in a complete side-scroller.

It features John Madden on the cover. The AI has been boosted and can now hurry in two-minute drill situations, spike the ball, and cover the receivers with better efficiency. Among the innovations in Madden 96, the Create-a-Player feature was added, which included many position specific mini-games that would determine the ability of the player. The game also was the first in the Madden series to include secret \"classic\" teams, which were unlocked by playing any of the 28 pre-expansion NFL franchises in the playoffs and by winning Super Bowl XXX with that team (a rather easy feat as the playoff tournament system allows a player to abort the game while in the lead and still win). The 28 pre-expansion teams were each represented by a classic era equivalent, which ranged from 1960 (Philadelphia Eagles) to 1986 (New York Giants), although all players identified as number-only. Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers, having debuted in 1995, did not have a secret classic team revealed in this manner, nor did the All-Madden team. However, Carolina was attached to the blank slate NFLPA team used for Create-a-Player, and Jacksonville and All-Madden hid the \"superteams\" with players named after the developers; these teams were accessed using unstated cheat codes.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"EA Sports","Developer":"Tiburon Entertainment","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"25131","PlatformId":"20"},{"id":"4490","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"28033","PlatformId":"36"},{"id":"11160","PlatformId":"10"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/290-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/290-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/290-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"1000","height":"705","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/290-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/290-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"1000","height":"704","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/290-1.jpg"}}]}},"Madden NFL '97":{"id":"291","GameTitle":"Madden NFL 97","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"10/01/1996","Overview":"Welcome to Madden NFL 97, the game that captures the excitement of a 30 yard touchdown pass, the strategy of a well executed scoring drive, and the atmosphere of a crisp autumn afternoon in the stadium.

The first mention of Muhammad Ali Boxing was at the Summer CES in 1993. It is not clear why this game did not get released, but it perhaps was due to Virgin's focus on the Genesis version (which happened with Mick and Mac, also unreleased on the SNES).\r\n\r\nA prototype ROM image exists for this game. It is unknown what the source of it is. The prototype is a relatively early version of the game. The graphics are largely the same between the boxers (the head sprite is different in the boxer selection screen, but nothing is different during actual gameplay). The game seemed to feature an interesting rotating boxing ring. There are no sounds in the game, aside from an announcer at the title screen. The gameplay is not very polished, and computer opponent usually beats you within seconds. There are no visual clues as to what causes the TKO, aside from the TKO meter that is not necessarily depleted when you lose.","Genres":{"genre":"Fighting"},"Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QnZPe5o4Ak","Publisher":"Virgin","Developer":"Park Place Productions","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/37774-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"256","height":"224","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/37774-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/37774-1.jpg","$":{"width":"480","height":"360"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/37774-1.jpg"}}},"Mujintou Monogatari":{},"Multi Game Hunter BIOS":{},"Multi Play Volleyball":{"id":"29041","GameTitle":"Multi Play Volleyball","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"10/28/1994","Overview":"The player controls a national volleyball squad (i.e., Cuba, USA, Canada, Brazil) as the play controls the entire team using an overhead view.

The seventh hero is you, the protagonist of the game - the knight Remeer or the female warrior Ferris. Your first task will be to release your companions from the statues they are locked in.

But your main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds and to find seven mystic arks - the items that will re-unite those Worlds and bring peace to them.\r\n\r\n\"Mystic Ark\" is a RPG closely connected to  7th Saga. You travel on overworld map, visit towns, buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The combat is turn-based and viewed from a third-person \"over-the-shoulder\" perspective. The battles are not random: the enemies can be seen as white dots on your radar, and if you don't want to fight, you can sometimes outrun or avoid them. The game also contains elements of pure adventure: often you must investigate objects closely and use items from your inventory on them.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v0cf2lh01E","Publisher":"Produce","Developer":"Enix","Rating":"7","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/5621-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"640","height":"1171","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/5621-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/5621-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"1192","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/5621-1.jpg"}}]}},"Mystic Demo (PD)":{},"N-Warp Daisakusen V1.0 (PD)":{},"N-Warp Daisakusen V1.1 (PD)":{},"NBA All-Star Challenge":{"id":"5623","GameTitle":"NBA All-Star Challenge","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1992","Overview":"NBA All-Star Challenge offers one-on-one basketball featuring NBA players from the 1991-1992 season.

These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. \r\n\r\nNobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.\r\n\r\nDuring each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.","Genres":{"genre":"Strategy"},"Players":"4+","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Koei","Developer":"Koei","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"36603","PlatformId":"4929"},{"id":"1978","PlatformId":"7"},{"id":"21686","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"4536","PlatformId":"18"}]},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/5715-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/5715-1.jpg"},"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/5715-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"403","height":"266","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/5715-1.jpg"}}}},"Nobunaga's Ambition - Lord of Darkness":{"id":"3214","GameTitle":"Nobunaga's Ambition: Lord of Darkness","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"10/01/1994","Overview":"Nobunaga's Ambition: Lord of Darkness is the fourth game in the Nobunaga series (but only the third one to have been localized in English).

A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre. Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps. The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts. Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the \"gold\" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"U.S. Gold","Developer":"Black Pearl","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"4","Game":[{"id":"10133","PlatformId":"25"},{"id":"21687","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"4538","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"28055","PlatformId":"36"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/5719-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"475","height":"347","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/5719-1.jpg"}}}},"On the Ball":{},"Ongaku Tsukuru - Kanadeeru":{},"Onita Atsushi FMW":{},"Onita Atsushi FMW - Kagekara no Chousen":{},"Onizuka Katsuya Super Virtual Boxing":{},"Oozumou Tamashii":{},"Operation Europe - Path to Victory 1939-45":{"id":"5721","GameTitle":"Operation Europe: Path to Victory 1939-45","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1994","Overview":"The game is an historical simulation of the European and North African theaters of World War II.

Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.\r\n\r\nThere are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.\r\n\r\nYou also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.\r\n\r\nThere are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Taito Corporation","Developer":"Aisystem Tokyo","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"3","Game":[{"id":"9566","PlatformId":"4911"},{"id":"28545","PlatformId":"4914"},{"id":"6685","PlatformId":"40"}]},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/5722-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"256","height":"169","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/5722-1.jpg"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/5722.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"107"}}}},"Oraga Land Shusai - Best Farmer Shuukaku-Sai":{},"Oscar":{"id":"5723","GameTitle":"Oscar","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1996","Overview":"Your name is Oscar.

It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken.

Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a \"wall\" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends.

Apparently, your friend, doggie, likes to eat cookies that has his picture on their box, and he got himself so carried away that he lost the balance, and a bag of cookies fell deep down into an ant-hill. Now, you're goin' in, in a mission of solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for your friend.\r\n\r\nNow, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from the one you live in. It's path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates, and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place inside, you'll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend doggie.\r\n\r\nThe main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently. Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you cannot practice that, so if you jusp from a little bit too high position, don't expect much, but to retry the level.\r\n\r\nEvery block, or boulder in a game has a different markings. Like for example, the yellow ones are bricks you can push, and they will just as easily fall, and push, or not, the brick in front of it. The red ones will do the opposite, you cannot push them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits it, it'll continue falling back to the other side. Some bricks explode when you push them, or other brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, 'til they hit some other brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not, the brick in front of them.

Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art's Racing Destruction Set in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It is a precursor to Rock 'n Roll Racing, which was done by the same developer. Combat, obstacles and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role. There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement, dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro and mines. Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks and armor. There are full race season, single race and custom track modes. In 1 player games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle. In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before. Custom track designing is not intuitive but fairly easy to learn. Players can set the track's laps, gravity and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90° turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. The starting grid can be oriented forward, reversed, face-off with player 1 forward, or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6 slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1), inclined (1:1), or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections is provided to help to orient the section's design to the adjacent sections. If the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s), the player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error immediately. But such error must be eliminated before the track can be saved. Also required for a track to be saved is no dead ends, and a starting grid section. The track verification is surprisingly liberal, even allowing diverging and converging paths that are against the flow of traffic (like turning around and going the wrong way up a freeway merging lane). The AI opponents are generally not able to discern the fastest or shortest route and can even be diverted into a path with no natural exit, or with very clever path designs, valid lap paths can be entirely different for player 1, player 2 and AI players; which can lead to interesting traffic patterns.","Genres":{"genre":"Racing"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Interplay","Developer":"Blizzard Entertainment","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/5818-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"2100","height":"1536","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/5818-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/5818-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"2100","height":"1494","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/5818-1.jpg"}}]}},"RTS - Mode 7 Demo (PD)":{},"RTS - Tracks Demo (PD)":{},"Race Drivin'":{"id":"5801","GameTitle":"Race Drivin'","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1992","Overview":"Race Drivin' is a sequel to the arcade driving simulator Hard Drivin'.

In order to get vengeance on his peers he performs a ceremony in the gym (most likely referencing the original Megami Tensei) that transports his high school into Makai, the netherworld, where he has somehow become powerful enough to become Majin-Nou (Demon God Emperor). Back at the school, everyone freaks out and is scared except for a select few.The player assumes the role a nameless male or female student, who armed themselves with defensive equipment and COMP. They investigate the realms of Makai which are based on 5 of the 7 deadly sins, and finally face off against Hazama. In their quest, the player will be accompanied by fellow students and demons recruited through either negotiation or from the process of fusion, or via the Jakyou.There are four possible paths in the game, but unlike the previous games, they are not decided by the alignment system. Instead, right in the beginning of the game the player must choose one of the four main characters as a companion to investigate the misterious events and the Makai. Each main character has a defined path and once one has been chosen, the player is locked on that path. Yumi, Reiko and Charlie visit the worlds based off the deadly sins (Yumi and Reiko visit the same worlds, Charlie visits a few different ones), while Akira puts the player in an entirely different setting. Akira's path is much more difficult and, instead of being segmented among worlds, is composed by just one huge tower very similar to Persona 3's Tartarus. This path focuses much more heavily on the 'Dungeon Crawler' aspect of the game.Each of the worlds raise a few philosophical questions about the nature and consequences of the deadly sins, but the game presents these conflicts in a non-theological manner.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Atlus","Developer":"Atlus","Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/21146-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/21146-1.jpg"},"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/21146-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"538","height":"962","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/21146-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/21146-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"526","height":"964","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/21146-1.jpg"}}]}},"Shin Momotarou Densetsu":{"id":"34644","GameTitle":"Shin Momotarou Densetsu","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"12/24/1993","Overview":"Shin Momotarou Densetsu is a Role-Playing game, published by Hudson, which was released in Japan in 1993.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3B6_s8EdSw","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/34644-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"226","height":"400","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/34644-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/34644-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"223","height":"400","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/34644-1.jpg"}}],"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/34644-1.jpg","$":{"width":"260","height":"226"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/34644-1.jpg"}}},"Shin Naki no Ryuu - Mahjong Hishouden":{},"Shin Nekketsu Kouha - Kunio-tachi no Banka":{"id":"23216","GameTitle":"Shin Nekketsu Kouha: Kunio-tachi no Banka","AlternateTitles":{"title":"新・熱血硬派 くにおたちの挽歌"},"PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1994","Overview":"Kunio and Riki are convicted of a hit and run accident and the two are sentenced to be locked away in the West Nerima Juvenile Correction Facility.

You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and \"shipsmarts\".\r\n\r\nIn 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.\r\n\r\nThere are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.\r\n\r\nEach level has a certain \"save limit\", meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some assistance.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.","Genres":{"genre":"Strategy"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Mindscape Inc.","Developer":"Titus","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/5856-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"475","height":"347","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/5856-1.png"}}}},"Siren Manga Volume 1 (PD)":{},"Skins Game, The":{},"Skipp and Friends - Unexpected Journey V4.01pdrc (PD)":{},"Skuljagger - Revolt of the Westicans":{},"Sky Blazer":{},"Sky Destroyer by A&S from NES":{},"Slayers":{"id":"5861","GameTitle":"Slayers","AlternateTitles":{"title":"スレイヤーズ"},"PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"06/24/1994","Overview":"Slayers is based on an manga series of the same name (also known as Lina the Teenage Sorceress).

The main portion of the game is Tour mode, where the player visits a series of different levels representing different countries of the world. Each player's character is armed with a gun, which shoots a vertical cable. If this hits a bubble, it will cause it to split in two. Upgrades allow two cables to be shot at once, or the ability to stick a cable to the ceiling where it will cling for a few seconds, bursting any bubble that hits it.\r\n\r\nPlayers must clear each screen of bubbles before progressing to the next one. The largest bubbles will have 4 degrees of splitting before clearing. Many level layouts have ladders, barriers and breakable bricks in part of the screen, affecting movement of both the player and the bubbles. Faster bubbles in the shape of diamonds also bounce around the screen going any which way rather than bouncing in predictable arcs like the other bubbles.\r\n\r\nSeveral power-up tokens are also available, offering features such as splitting all bubbles down to their minimal size, freezing the bubbles for a few seconds, and various different weapons. Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can often be directed by the cable weapon.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the main Tour mode, the game also features Panic mode, in which a succession of bubbles are thrown at at the players. As the player progresses, the amount of bubbles required to reach the next level also increases, similar to scoring on Tetris.","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Avalon","Developer":"Capcom","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/6152-1.png","$":{"side":"front","width":"475","height":"347","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/6152-1.png"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/6152-1.jpg","$":{"width":"260","height":"226"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/6152-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/6152-2.jpg","$":{"width":"260","height":"226"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/6152-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/6152-3.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"479"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/6152-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/6152-4.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"1024"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/6152-4.jpg"}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/6152.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"234"}}}},"Super Caesars Palace":{},"Super Casino 2":{"id":"26900","GameTitle":"Super Casino 2","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"10/28/1994","Overview":"Super Casino 2 is a Miscellaneous game, developed by OeRSTED and published by Coconuts Japan, which was released in Japan in 1994.","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Coconuts Japan","Developer":"OeRSTED","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/26900-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"325","height":"589","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/26900-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":{"original":{"_":"screenshots/26900-1.jpg","$":{"width":"260","height":"226"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/26900-1.jpg"}}},"Super Castles":{},"Super Castlevania IV":{"id":"1308","GameTitle":"Super Castlevania IV","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"12/01/1991","Overview":"A century of Transylvanian tranquility is about to come to a shocking end.

Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.  Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.

The game is divided into two main gameplay modes, Movement and Battle.  Movement has the player travel through the city using the D-pad and a map located on the bottom of the screen with the objective being to destroy certain objectives such as enemy humans and buildings as well as pick up power-ups.  There is an animation in the screen above the map that shows the results of their movements and attacks.\r\n\r\nBattle mode kicks in when the player locates an enemy on the map, like Biollante or Mechagodzilla, and is taken to a side-scrolling cinematic-style battle where the player must use punches, tail whips and the famous fire breath to drain the energy of the opposing monster.  However, the Fighting Spirit system is present which is in a sense a morality meter where the player must pick the right attacks at the right time in order to connect certain attacks.  Choosing the wrong attacks or failing to connect with them will cause the meter to drop and make Godzilla more vulnerable to attack.","Genres":{"genre":"Action"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBQ0yNghw_s","Publisher":"Toho","Developer":"Toho","Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/6161-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/6161-1.jpg"},"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/6161-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"620","height":"433","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/6161-1.jpg"}}}},"Super Gomoku Narabe - Renju":{},"Super Gomoku Shougi":{},"Super Gussun Oyoyo":{"id":"25894","GameTitle":"Super Gussun Oyoyo","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"08/11/1995","Overview":"Super Gussun Oyoyo is an extremely cute action/puzzle game by Banpresto, and conversion of Irem's arcade game of the same name originally released in 1993. The game is an interesting and unique crossover between the 'puzzly' side of Tetris and the 'save all the rodents' side of Lemmings. The goal of the game is to guide a bald and fun looking creature, who also happens to be a treasure hunter called Gussun (and his friend Oyoyo in two players mode), to the level's exit. This character just keeps walking around and gets scared at the silliest things. While he aimlessly wanders around the playfield, Tetris like pieces fall from the top of the screen, and the player must rotate and position them in the scene. Once in place, these blocks can be used by Gussun to climb on to reach new areas, and eventually lead him through the exit door. Tons of other features are also packed with the game, such as bombs or little buddies who follow Gussun to the exit (collect 10 of them for an extra life!). Time is of course limited and water starts filling up the stage if players stay in one levels for too long. Additionally, traps and monsters soon appear and things get quickly tricky and will squeeze the juice out of the player's brain in no time. An intense two-player versus mode and a level editor are also available.","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Banpresto","Developer":"Banpresto","Rating":"6","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/25894-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"300","height":"431","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/25894-1.jpg"}}}},"Super Gussun Oyoyo 2":{"id":"14790","GameTitle":"Super Gussun Oyoyo 2","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"05/24/1996","Overview":"Released in Japan in 1996.","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Banpresto","Developer":"Kan's","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/14790-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"351","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/14790-1.jpg"}}}},"Super Hanafuda":{},"Super Hanafuda 2":{},"Super High Impact":{"id":"6162","GameTitle":"Super High Impact","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1993","Overview":"Super High Impact was one of the most hard hitting football games before the NFL Blitz series was created, with 18 teams and over 30 plays per team.

Battles with the enemy, either through random encounters or visible on the map is where the action starts. The characters enter a side-scrolling 'battle mode' where they may jump, fight, use their special techniques, items and spells, as well as activate various bonuses on the battlefield by breaking open the bonus boxes. A battle is over and experience points awarded when a pre-determined number of enemies are defeated or the Ninja Boys are defeated.\r\n\r\nWhen bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are given to Jack and Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills acquired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way.

The main portion of the game is Tour mode, where the player visits a series of different levels representing different countries of the world. Each player's character is armed with a gun, which shoots a vertical cable. If this hits a bubble, it will cause it to split in two. Upgrades allow two cables to be shot at once, or the ability to stick a cable to the ceiling where it will cling for a few seconds, bursting any bubble that hits it.\r\n\r\nPlayers must clear each screen of bubbles before progressing to the next one. The largest bubbles will have 4 degrees of splitting before clearing. Many level layouts have ladders, barriers and breakable bricks in part of the screen, affecting movement of both the player and the bubbles. Faster bubbles in the shape of diamonds also bounce around the screen going any which way rather than bouncing in predictable arcs like the other bubbles.\r\n\r\nSeveral power-up tokens are also available, offering features such as splitting all bubbles down to their minimal size, freezing the bubbles for a few seconds, and various different weapons. Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can often be directed by the cable weapon.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the main Tour mode, the game also features Panic mode, in which a succession of bubbles are thrown at at the players. As the player progresses, the amount of bubbles required to reach the next level also increases, similar to scoring on Tetris.","ESRB":"EC - Early Childhood","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Developer":"Capcom","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"26871","PlatformId":"23"}},"Images":{"fanart":{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/24107-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/24107-1.jpg"},"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/24107-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"800","height":"559","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/24107-1.jpg"}},"screenshot":[{"original":{"_":"screenshots/24107-1.jpg","$":{"width":"640","height":"479"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/24107-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"screenshots/24107-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"1024"}},"thumb":"screenshots/thumb/24107-2.jpg"}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/24107.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"175"}}}},"Super Pachinko":{},"Super Pachinko Taisen":{},"Super Pinball - Behind the Mask":{"id":"6167","GameTitle":"Super Pinball: Behind the Mask","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1994","Overview":"Super Pinball: Behind the Mask is a pinball simulator for the SNES featuring three completely unique tables: the clown-themed \"Jolly Joker\", the pirate themed \"Blackbeard and Ironmen\", and the fantasy-themed \"Wizard\".\r\n\r\nAll tables are shown in a tilted 3D view, which fits the entire table on the screen without the need for scrolling, with marquee messages and bonuses displayed as giant overlays on the screen.

Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line \"standard\" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.\r\n\r\nThe most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.\r\n\r\nTetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.","Genres":{"genre":["Action","Puzzle"]},"Players":"4+","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Blue Planet Software","Developer":"TOSE","Rating":"9","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/25772-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"351","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/25772-1.jpg"}}}},"Super Troll Islands":{"id":"6176","GameTitle":"Super Troll Islands","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1993","Overview":"Arcade platform game, based on the license of those bright-haired cute naked chaps.

It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that!\r\n\r\nThe game's main claim to fame is its intro theme, which incorporates a vocal track. Normally, such a track cannot be done on the SNES, as all assets for a single song must fit into the 64kB audio buffer before the song can be played. This technical limit was overcome by slicing the vocal track into small samples and swapping them in and out of the audio buffer. The rest of the intro theme is standard MIDI.\r\n\r\n\"Tales of Phantasia\" presents a unique combat system. The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.","ESRB":"E10+ - Everyone 10+","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Namco","Developer":"Wolf Team","Rating":"7.2857","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"2","Game":[{"id":"4025","PlatformId":"5"},{"id":"12478","PlatformId":"10"}]},"Images":{"fanart":[{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/6232-1.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/6232-1.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/6232-2.jpg","$":{"width":"1280","height":"720"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/6232-2.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/6232-3.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/6232-3.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/6232-4.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/6232-4.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/6232-5.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/6232-5.jpg"},{"original":{"_":"fanart/original/6232-6.jpg","$":{"width":"1920","height":"1080"}},"thumb":"fanart/thumb/6232-6.jpg"}],"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/6232-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"960","height":"523","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/6232-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/6232-2.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"954","height":"522","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/6232-2.jpg"}}]}},"Tamagotchi Town":{},"Tamori no Picross":{},"Tantei Kurabu - Yuki ni Kieta Kako - Chuuhen":{},"Tantei Kurabu - Yuki ni Kieta Kako - Kouhen":{},"Tantei Kurabu - Yuki ni Kieta Kako - Zenpen":{},"Tarot Mystery":{},"Tarzan by TegPeru (Jungle Book Hack)":{},"Taurus Intro (PD)":{},"Taz-Mania":{"id":"6233","GameTitle":"Taz-Mania","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"05/01/1993","Overview":"This version of Taz-Mania is different from the side-scrolling versions by Sega, in this version the player controls Taz from a third-person perspective.

T-800's default weapon is a pistol, but he can later acquire other weapons such as a shotgun, a mini-gun, etc. The \"good terminator\" can also use kicks and punches to dispose of the enemies. As in the movie, T-1000 appears frequently and must be fought and incapacitated, but can not be permanently killed until the ending part.\r\n\r\nAnother objective the player must complete is collecting various robotic parts that could lead to a construction of a new terminator.

Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.\r\n\r\nCatalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.\r\n\r\nPietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.\r\n\r\nErnst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.\r\n\r\nAli Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...\r\n\r\nOtto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.\r\n\r\nDuring naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.","Genres":{"genre":"Strategy"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Koei","Developer":"Koei","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"25385","PlatformId":"1"}},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/6321-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"268","height":"188","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/6321-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/6321-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"521","height":"361","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/6321-1.jpg"}}]}},"Undake 30 - Same Game Daisakusen - Mario Version":{},"Undercover Cops":{"id":"24818","GameTitle":"Undercover Cops","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"03/03/1995","Overview":"2043.

There are different types of ships, such as Fighters, Marauders or Destroyers, that differ in movement range and weapon power. Weapon power is also divided into long and short range, i.e. a ship that is very good at long range combat may have poor close ranged weapons etc. During combat, the following actions can be chosen from a menu: Movement, Attacking, terrain information, unit information, a map of the battlefield, overview of all units, including those of the enemy; and an option to scout planets for technology. When an attacking unit is within range of an attacked unit, the attacked unit will always counter-attack (if it isn't destroyed first). In later missions it becomes possible to scout planets for technology and upgrade ships, as well as take control of space stations to build new ships. Ships cannot be taken into the next mission however.","Genres":{"genre":"Strategy"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Advanced Productions","Developer":"Advanced Productions","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/6332-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"620","height":"433","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/6332-1.jpg"}}}},"Waratte Iitomo!

Further, there is occasionally an unstoppable snake that barrels down to the bottom of the space, eliminating all snakes in its path.\r\n\r\nThe game can be played with 1 or 2 players in either easy, normal or hard mode. In the single player mode, the player can choose whether the preview showing the next snake will be shown. In 2-player mode, there is always a preview window. In fact, there is a queue of 3 snakes between the 2 player spaces from which the next snake is drawn.

A failed mission can lead to either a dishonorable discharge or death for the pilot.","Genres":{"genre":"Flight Simulator"},"Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Namco Limited","Developer":"Namco Limited","Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/3289-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"2100","height":"1542","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/3289-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/3289-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"2100","height":"1551","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/3289-1.jpg"}}],"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/3289.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"120"}}}},"Winning Post":{},"Winning Post 2":{},"Winning Post 2 - Program '96":{},"Winter Extreme Skiing and Snowboarding":{},"Winter Gold":{"id":"6349","GameTitle":"Winter Gold","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1996","Overview":"Winter Gold is a winter sports game with events like bobsled, ski jump and snow boarding, all in a 3D graphics environment.\r\n\r\nBoth single player and multi player options are available; you can play with up to eight people in compete mode.","Genres":{"genre":"Sports"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Nintendo","Developer":"Funcom","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"1","Game":{"id":"27874","PlatformId":"4"}},"Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/6349-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"300","height":"204","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/6349-1.jpg"}}}},"Winter Olympic Games - Lillehammer '94":{"id":"6350","GameTitle":"Winter Olympic Games: Lillehammer '94","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1993","Overview":"Play the hottest game on ice and snow - Winter Olympic Games, the official licensed version of the 1994 Lillehammer Olympic Winter Games.

His greatest creation was an artificial boy named Pino. No, he was not carved from wood, but looked just like a real boy - only he could turn his head 360 degrees. But Gepetto was arrested for an unknown reason. The boy Pino looks like a real boy, but he was completed just a few moments ago, and he knows absolutely nothing. All he can do is wander aimlessly, poking objects and turning his head. It is up to you, the player, to make Pino a real man!\r\n\r\nIn this simulation/role-playing game, you must use the robotic pixie Tinker to educate Pino. You can move Tinker around, examining objects and collecting them in an adventure-like fashion. Pino will automatically follow you to the direction you are facing, but will continue walking until you stop him. He will also pick objects and make his own \"experiments\" with them. Your goal is to train PIno in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino you will gradually make him understand what should be done and what not.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Enix","Developer":"Almanic","Rating":"5.5","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/6352-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"300","height":"546","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/6352-1.jpg"}}}},"Wondrous Magic":{"id":"26316","GameTitle":"Wondrous Magic","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"12/17/1993","Overview":"Wondrous Magic is a Role-Playing game, developed by System Sacom and published by ASCII Entertainment, which was released in Japan in 1993.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"ASCII Entertainment","Developer":"System Sacom","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/26316-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"299","height":"528","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/26316-1.jpg"}}}},"Wordtris":{"id":"6353","GameTitle":"Wordtris","PlatformId":"6","Platform":"Super Nintendo (SNES)","ReleaseDate":"01/01/1992","Overview":"In the spirit of Tetris comes Wordtris.

If the shape is of a different color, or it is hit when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colors with the shape.","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Viacom New Media","Developer":"Hookstone","Rating":"4.5","Similar":{"SimilarCount":"6","Game":[{"id":"3991","PlatformId":"28"},{"id":"21818","PlatformId":"4"},{"id":"14070","PlatformId":"20"},{"id":"4752","PlatformId":"18"},{"id":"33737","PlatformId":"17"},{"id":"11626","PlatformId":"10"}]},"Images":{"boxart":[{"_":"boxart/original/back/3144-1.jpg","$":{"side":"back","width":"2091","height":"1494","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/back/3144-1.jpg"}},{"_":"boxart/original/front/3144-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"2100","height":"1542","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/3144-1.jpg"}}],"banner":{"_":"graphical/3144-g.jpg","$":{"width":"760","height":"140"}},"clearlogo":{"_":"clearlogo/3144.png","$":{"width":"400","height":"207"}}}},"Zootto Mahjong!":{},"Zootto Mahjong!
