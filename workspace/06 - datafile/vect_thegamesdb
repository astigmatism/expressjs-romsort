The player's ship must also be maneuvered through small holes in a series of walls where fuel cells can be picked up to restore the ship's constantly decreasing fuel supply. If the player pilots their ship successfully, they will be faced with the warlord's own escape ship which must be hit several times to be destroyed, liberating the star system from the warlord's tyranny.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach level becomes more difficult as everything will move faster, fuel will be consumed more quickly, the holes in the walls will become smaller, and more menacing defense forces will appear.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach level of game play consists of two phases:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Passages: During the first phase of each level, the player must maneuver their ship through the narrow, moving passages with the joystick while shooting six of the warlord's defense forces with button 4. If any of the six are missed, they will go off-screen and be recycled to give the player another chance, but more fuel will be used. In addition to various defense forces which must be destroyed, there are extra targets that can be shot for additional points. Unlike the regular defense forces, the extra targets are non-threatening in that they will not shoot or crash into the player's ship. During this phase, space debris will also be shooting up through the play field. Space debris cannot be shot and can only be avoided by dodging it by moving from side to side. The walls of the narrow passage are also a danger to the player. If the player's ship crashes into a wall, a life will be lost. There are gaps between the moving walls which the player can maneuver quickly into and out of so as to avoid approaching enemies or space debris, however as game play becomes faster this will present a higher risk to crashing into oncoming walls.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Walls: If the passages are successfully navigated and the the required six defense forces are destroyed, the player will enter the second phase. This is a series of walls with holes. In the first level of the game, there are five successive walls, each with one hole through which the player must maneuver their ship. In the second level of play, there will be six successive walls, in the third level, seven walls, etc. Also the size of the holes will become smaller in each new level. The hole will be in a different location on each wall. After passing through the hole in each wall (but prior to entering the hole in the next wall) there will be a fuel cell which must be passed to pick up. If the fuel cells are missed, the game will continue, but the fuel gauge will be continuously depleting. Note: in early levels of the game, all of the fuel cells will not need to be captured. However as the game progresses and fuel is consumed faster, all of the fuel cells will need to be captured in order to make it through the next level.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter successfully completing three levels of play, the player will come face-to-face with the warlord's escape ship in open space. The warlord's ship must be shot five times to be destroyed during the first encounter, seven times on the next encounter, nine times the next, etc. The warlord's ship will shoot torpedoes at the player's ship, which can be either avoided or shot at to be destroyed. If the warlord's escape ship is destroyed, the player will enter the next level of play and the game will continue.\",\"ESRB\":\"E - Everyone\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Shooter\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAOxNyUeRG8\",\"Publisher\":\"GCE\",\"Developer\":\"GCE\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/36977-1.png\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"505\",\"height\":\"680\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/36977-1.png\"}},\"screenshot\":{\"original\":{\"_\":\"screenshots/36977-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"width\":\"468\",\"height\":\"599\"}},\"thumb\":\"screenshots/thumb/36977-1.jpg\"}}}","3-D Scrolling Demo by Christopher Tumber (PD)":{},"4-D Rotating Cube Demo (PD)":{},"8Ball by Christopher Tumber (PD)":{},"Abyss Demo (PD)":{},"All Good Things by John Dondzila":"{\"id\":\"37530\",\"GameTitle\":\"All Good Things\",\"AlternateTitles\":{\"title\":\"All Good Things by John Dondzila\"},\"PlatformId\":\"4939\",\"Platform\":\"Vectrex\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"01/01/1996\",\"Overview\":\"From Packrat Video Games.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Good Things, was the world´s first 16K Vectrex cartridge, created by John Dondzila.

Players had to skim surfaces of the planets and destroy all the bunkers therein, as well as beam up fuel cells to maintain their fuel level(s) and avoiding or destroying saucers that would also appear. The game did not do very well commercially and would only be ported to the Atari 2600 a few years later (although it has reappeared on some modern day compilations since).\\r\\n\\r\\nGravitrex is a clone of Gravitar, although with many differences, such as the addition of humans dotting the planetary landscapes that have to be rescued, and the Gravitrex Plus cart also includes two bonus games and other features as well. All games are for one player only.\\r\\n\\r\\nGameplay:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe player controls a fighter ship that begins each game in a solar system. There is a sun in the middle and several planets to choose from to enter so the player can start their mission. If the player takes too long with choosing a planet, a pair of space saucers will emerge from the reactor planet and will engage the player in a dogfight if they get close enough (although the player can just elude them by entering a planet). If the player’s ship gets destroyed or the player shoots both saucers then the player will return to the main solar system screen.\\r\\nOnce the player enters a planet by thrusting into it, they must destroy every enemy bunker on the surface and dispose of every fuel tank and human. Humans and fuel tanks can be shot (although the player will not receive any points for doing so), but a bonus is given if all humans are rescued on a level (see Scoring and Extras sections), plus fuel tanks are needed to keep up the player’s fuel level (which is indicated by a line right next to the score at the top left of the screen). Humans and fuel tanks can be teleported into the player’s ship by maneuvering their ship close and activating the teleporter/shields function. Once all bunkers have been destroyed and all humans and fuel tanks have been disposed of, a sound effect will signal that the mission is complete, and upon leaving the planet, it will self-destruct and the player will be given a bonus for that planet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exception to this rule is the lone reactor planet on each level, which has only one target – a reactor – deep inside it. This planet is different than all the others, as the player is given 99 time units to make their way through a brief maze, shoot the reactor, and get out before time runs out or else the player’s ship will be destroyed and the reactor will remain intact. If the player does not destroy this planet last in a level then it clears out the space saucers for the remainder of the level, since this is the planet that they emerge from.\\r\\n\\r\\nDangers include the player’s ship crashing if it runs out of fuel, plus the ship will be destroyed if shot by a bunker, space saucer or alien air interceptor (which are similar to space saucers but they appear inside a planet), if they crash into a wall, the sun, space saucer or alien air interceptor, or do not leave the reactor planet before their time runs out. If the player runs out of reserve ships then the game will end. The player’s fuel, however, is replenished mostly from a fuel tank and is fully replaced upon destroying a planet, finishing a level, or with each new ship. The player’s teleporter function also doubles as a shield to protect them from enemy fire. Also, if the player defeats all planets in a level, then that level’s sun will go nova, various bonuses are then awarded (see Extras section), and if the player defeats the third level the game will end, giving a congratulations message as well as sharing some trivia about Gravitrex from the game’s programmer John Dondzila on the screen.\",\"ESRB\":\"E - Everyone\",\"Genres\":{\"genre\":\"Shooter\"},\"Players\":\"1\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Publisher\":\"Classic Game Creations\",\"Developer\":\"John Dondzila\",\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/37532-1.jpg\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"360\",\"height\":\"501\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/37532-1.jpg\"}}}}","Great Giana Sisters (Bonus) by Chris Salomon (PD)":{},"Great Giana Sisters (Ingame) by Chris Salomon (PD)":{},"Great Giana Sisters (Title) by Chris Salomon (PD)":{},"Heads Up - Action Soccer":"{\"id\":\"32368\",\"GameTitle\":\"Heads Up\",\"AlternateTitles\":{\"title\":[\"Soccer Football\",\"Heads Up\"]},\"PlatformId\":\"4939\",\"Platform\":\"Vectrex\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"05/04/1983\",\"Overview\":\"The player controls one of three active members of their team as well as the defensive goalie.

In the center of the screen is the sun, which pulls objects into it, in a fashion similar to Spacewar!. The screen wraps at the edges.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaves of enemy spaceships appear in groups of up to eight. There are seven different types of ships, growing smaller to make them harder to hit. Each \\\"phase\\\" of the gameplay completes when each of the seven waves is destroyed. The spaceships are a collision hazard and normally fly around the screen randomly. As the game progresses, they become more likely to attempt to ram the player directly. At higher levels, the ships gain weapons and attempt to shoot the player.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe player's ship is armed with two weapons, a cannon and a \\\"nuke\\\". The cannon fires a single shot in the direction your ship is pointed, and the game allows up to four shots on screen at once. The nuke destroys all ships in the area when it is triggered, which occurs with a second button press after being launched from the ship. The player's ship starts the game with three nukes and gains a new one every 10000 points.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever an alien ship is destroyed, a \\\"survivor\\\" is left drifting in space. The player can collect the survivors by flying his ship over them. Alternately he can shoot them, or allow them to fall into the sun. The player is awarded with points for successful rescues, and eventually free ships.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game is remembered fondly by many players, and Simon Burns of VoxelArcade called it \\\"freedom under an overlaid blue sky\\\".\",\"Co-op\":\"No\",\"Youtube\":\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtWQdYIyiP8\",\"Publisher\":\"Cinematronics\",\"Developer\":\"Cinematronics\",\"Similar\":{\"SimilarCount\":\"1\",\"Game\":{\"id\":\"14945\",\"PlatformId\":\"23\"}},\"Images\":{\"boxart\":{\"_\":\"boxart/original/front/32728-1.png\",\"$\":{\"side\":\"front\",\"width\":\"400\",\"height\":\"500\",\"thumb\":\"boxart/thumb/original/front/32728-1.png\"}}}}","Song Demo by Christopher Tumber (PD)":{},"Sound1 Demo (PD)":{},"Space Wars":"{\"id\":\"32799\",\"GameTitle\":\"Space Wars\",\"PlatformId\":\"4939\",\"Platform\":\"Vectrex\",\"ReleaseDate\":\"05/05/1982\",\"Overview\":\"The player(s) control a space ship in a space field with only the sun, their opponent's ship, and an occasional asteroid to contend with.
