It is a crossover game, featuring characters from several classic Namco titles.\r\n\r\nThe game is played on a square grid, on which both the player's and computer's units are placed. Each side takes turns moving and making actions with their units. Every character has a variety of attacks and special moves that can be selected when performing an action. Some of these consume Spirit Points, which slowly regenerate each turn. The game is divided into stages. Between each stage, the player is able to visit a shop and prepare his units before starting the next stage. Unlike most RPGs, characters do not gain levels for directly defeating opponents. Instead, completion of a map will reward the players with a number of level ups, which they can then distribute among their units as they wish.","Genres":{"genre":"Strategy"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Bandai","Developer":"Namco","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27742-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"904","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27742-1.jpg"}}}},"RUN=DIM Return to Earth":{"id":"19641","GameTitle":"Run=Dim: Return to Earth","PlatformId":"4926","Platform":"WonderSwan Color","ReleaseDate":"02/07/2002","Overview":"Run=Dim: Return to Earth is an Action game, developed and published by Digital Dream, which was released in Japan in 2002.","Genres":{"genre":"Shooter"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Digital Dream","Developer":"Digital Dream","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/19641-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"338","height":"400","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/19641-1.jpg"}}}},"Rockman EXE N1 Battle":{"id":"27749","GameTitle":"RockMan EXE N1 Battle","PlatformId":"4926","Platform":"WonderSwan Color","ReleaseDate":"08/08/2003","Overview":"RockMan EXE N1 Battle is a Role-Playing game, developed by Inti Creates and published by Capcom, which was released in Japan in 2003.","Genres":{"genre":"Role-Playing"},"Players":"1","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Capcom","Developer":"Inti Creates","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27749-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"270","height":"382","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27749-1.jpg"}}}},"Taikyoku Igo Heisei Kiin":{"id":"31927","GameTitle":"Taikyoku Igo: Heisei Kiin","PlatformId":"4925","Platform":"WonderSwan","Co-op":"No","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/31927-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"334","height":"408","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/31927-1.jpg"}}}},"Tetris":{},"TextDemo by Goldmomo (PD)":{},"WWWLib - BG1 & BG2 & Sprite Test by Orion_ (PD)":{},"WWWLib - Full Maptest by Orion_ (PD)":{},"WWWLib - TestJB by Orion_ (PD)":{},"WWWLib - TestJB16 by Orion_ (PD)":{},"WWWLib - TestJB4 by Orion_ (PD)":{},"Walking Dudes Demo V1 by Zalas (PD)":{},"WonderPong by LiraNuna (PD)":{},"WonderProject First Demo by Orion_ (PD)":{},"WonderProject First Demo by Orion_ (PD) ":{},"WonderSwan Register Diagnostic by Zalas (PD)":{},"Wondergate":{},"X - Card of Fate":{"id":"27768","GameTitle":"X: Card of Fate","PlatformId":"4926","Platform":"WonderSwan Color","ReleaseDate":"06/27/2002","Overview":"X: Card of Fate is a Strategy game, developed by Access and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2002.","Genres":{"genre":"Strategy"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Bandai","Developer":"Bandai","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27768-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"272","height":"400","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27768-1.jpg"}}}},"XI  Little":{"id":"27771","GameTitle":"XI (sai) Little","PlatformId":"4926","Platform":"WonderSwan Color","ReleaseDate":"12/20/2001","Overview":"XI (sai) Little is a Puzzle game, developed by MBI and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2001.","Genres":{"genre":"Puzzle"},"Players":"2","Co-op":"No","Publisher":"Bandai","Developer":"MBI","Images":{"boxart":{"_":"boxart/original/front/27771-1.jpg","$":{"side":"front","width":"640","height":"921","thumb":"boxart/thumb/original/front/27771-1.jpg"}}}},"Ys 1 - Boss Out - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - Devil's Step - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - Final Battle - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - First Step Towards Wars - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - Fly with Me - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - Fountain of Love - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - Holders of Power - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - In the Memory - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - Lucky - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - Open Your Heart - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - Palace - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - Palace of Destruction - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - Rest in Peace - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - Tears of Sylph - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - Tension - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - The Last Moment of the Dark - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{},"Ys 1 - The Syonin - Arranged by Atsushi Watanabe (PD) ":{}}
